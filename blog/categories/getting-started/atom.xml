    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The web is full of great information on what you should be doing
when starting a podcast. There are hundreds, if not thousands,
of blog posts and web sites dedicated to helping you get up
and running &ndash; this one included. It doesn&rsquo;t take much more than
a google search or asking on twitter to find what you need to
know!</p>

<p>But this isn&rsquo;t another one of those feel-good, tell me what
I need posts. Rather, I want to mention a few of the things
that you should avoid doing when you&rsquo;re starting out. Understanding
what you should <em>not</em> do is just as important as understanding
what you <em>should</em> be doing &ndash; sometimes more important. These are
the things that will drive you to drink, if you&rsquo;re not careful.
These are the things that you should avoid doing, at all costs.</p>

<h2>#4: Stop Waiting To Start</h2>

<p><strong>This is the first great mistake that people make when starting
a podcast.</strong> They wait. They wait some more. They push things
back, and they delay yet again.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get sucked in to
the idea that you&rsquo;re not ready. It&rsquo;s easy to fall victim to
procrastination, and to make yourself look busy without making
any actual progress.</p>

<p>Unforunately, it&rsquo;s in our nature to procrastinate. Even the
most amazing podcasters, like <a href="http://eofire.com">John Lee Dumas</a>,
have fallen victim to the delays. In <a href="http://launchingcreative.com/episode-1/">his interview with the Launching Creative podcast</a>
[starting at 31:25], John talked about how he was delaying and delaying until his
mentor finally said that he would be dropped as a client if he
didn&rsquo;t release the first episode that day. In the end, John
realized that the delays he put on himself were only setting
him back, not helping him.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Get out there. Launch. Fail. Make mistakes. Improve.&rdquo; &ndash; John Lee Dumas</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>There is nothing that will demotivate
you faster than not getting your podcast published and live
for the world to hear.</strong> The sense of accomplishment and having
produced something is a tremendously motivating thing. You&rsquo;ll
find that once you start the work &ndash; once you start recording
and publishing episodes &ndash; you&rsquo;ll want to do more.</p>

<p>Getting started and getting your first episode published is
by far the most important thing you can do for your podcasting
career or hobby.</p>

<h2>#3: Don&rsquo;t Obsess Over Your Stats (Listeners And Subscribers)</h2>

<p>Unless you&rsquo;re already internet famous, you&rsquo;re not going to launch
to a massive audience. You won&rsquo;t have thousands of downloads,
instantly. Chances are, you&rsquo;re not even going to have hundreds
of downloads until you&rsquo;re at least a few episodes in to the
podcast.</p>

<p><strong>Stop. Watching. Your. Reports.</strong></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal, and the reason this is so important: podcasts
are an inconsistent stream of traffic per episode. You might see a
number that you like after the first week of your first episode.
You might even see a bump after the second week. But once you
release that second or third episode, the numbers won&rsquo;t be as high.
And the next episode? Even lower. <strong>THIS IS NORMAL!</strong></p>

<p>The average shelf life of a podcast episode is 6 weeks. <strong>6
weeks.</strong> This means your first episode will continue to accrue
traffic for around 6 weeks. You&rsquo;ll stil get traffic hitting it
after that, but it won&rsquo;t be as steady. During that 6 weeks of
life for your first episode, your other episodes won&rsquo;t have
as much traffic. You&rsquo;ll see a natural dip in the numbers
because those episodes haven&rsquo;t been around as long and won&rsquo;t
instantly catch up or shoot past your first one.</p>

<p><strong>It takes time for the numbers to settle in and level out.
Only after the shelf life of your first episode will you be able
to see that your audience is growing.</strong> And it&rsquo;s the slow, steady
growth of a continuing podcast, week after week, that you want to see.</p>

<h2>#2: Don&rsquo;t Wait For Listeners To Find You</h2>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you build it, they will come&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>the Field Of Dreams Fallacy
has cursed a generation of movie lovers in to thinking that
they will have instant fans and stardom.</strong> The idea is that
if you just build it and ship it, people will find it and love
you. <strong>This couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth.</strong> But you
know what? That&rsquo;s ok.</p>

<p><strong>You&rsquo;re not doing this for instant
celebrity status</strong>, and the drug-rush of watching your stats
fly off the meter. And believe me &ndash; this is a habbit forming
drug. I suffer from this as much as anyone else I know. It&rsquo;s
the curse of the always-on, data-filled digital lives that
we live. We want to see every time someone hits our site, listens
to our podcast, or tells us something on twitter, facebook,
and every other site in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Get 10 episodes published, first</strong> &ndash; not just &ldquo;done&rdquo;, but
actually published. Talk about the episodes on twitter, facebook,
pinterest and everywhere else. Blog about the episodes &ndash; <strong>every
episode gets a blog post</strong>, in fact. Find places with people
that would benefit from your podcast and tell those
people about it. Do this for 10 episodes and then
start looking at your stats. You&rsquo;ll see growth, instead of flat
or falling numbers.</p>

<p>Once you see growth, you know you&rsquo;ve started to show up on
people&rsquo;s radar. <strong>Listeners will start to find you. But that
doesn&rsquo;t mean your done.</strong> The reason people are starting to find
you now is because you did the leg work of putting yourself
in front of them. <strong>Don&rsquo;t stop doing the leg work. Keep it up.
Your audience will grow.</strong></p>

<h2>#1: Don&rsquo;t Stop!</h2>

<p>This, above all other things, is the biggest mistake that new
podcasters make.</p>

<p><strong>The average podcast only makes it to episode 6 or 7 before it
stops.</strong> There are a lot of reasons for this, but in my
experience and in talking with others, it usually comes down to
time committment and what looks like a lack of growth in
audience. It just doesn&rsquo;t seem to be worth the effort, and
your day job is getting stressful again while the spouse and/or
kids are starting to wonder where you&rsquo;re at in the evenings&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s easy to get overhwelmed.</strong> And it&rsquo;s easy to think that
you need to have a regular and set schedule in order to be
a podcaster. After all, most of the podcasting industry tells
you this. <strong>Don&rsquo;t believe it for a minute.</strong> This is your
podcast; this is your story; your life; your work. You and only
you are in charge of how often you release an episode.</p>

<p>Just because you missed a week (or 7), or you only have time to
release one episode every month, doesn&rsquo;t mean you should
give up. Schedule the time for your podcast, like you would
do with anything else in your life. Set time aside, but
only time that you are comfortable with. <strong>Don&rsquo;t push yourself
to do more just because some podcasting &ldquo;professional&rdquo;
says you have to.</strong> You don&rsquo;t need to stop podcasting just
because you can&rsquo;t get this episode done and released &ldquo;on time&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Most Importantly: Have Fun!</h2>

<p>Podcasting is the new media revolution for this decade. Much
like blogging was in the previous decade, there will be alot of
growth and change in the industry. Join the growing community
and let your voice be heard. Build intimate connections with
your audience and allow them to know you, on your terms. This is
an exciting new media opportunity on many fronts, and <strong>it should
be something you enjoy!</strong> It may be hard work &ndash; well, it <em>will</em>
be hard work at times &ndash; but <strong>nothing worth doing is easy</strong>.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-14T07:53:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2014/01/14/episode-4-with-craig-mckeachie</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Signals And Leaves, Episode 4 with <a href="http://www.funnyant.com/">Craig McKeachie</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Craig is starting up a new podcast on front-end web development
and is going through all the usual steps of getting started,
getting episodes recorded and getting them published.</p>

<p>This episode was recorded live at <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash 2014</a>
in a room that was full of noise from ventilation and other
environmental things. I used <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>
to clean up the noise, which worked surprisingly well. There is
some noise leftover during louder portions of the audio, though.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Podcast Pro-tip</h3>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t forget your guests' name or credentials.</strong></p>

<p>This one is rather embarassing, I must say. Right as I was
starting the episode with Craig, I forgot his name. My brain
went completely blank. We laught it off at the beginning of
the episode, but it makes for a bad start to the episode.</p>

<h3>Equipment</h3>

<p>This episode was recorded entirely with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IJ3WIW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003IJ3WIW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=signalleaf-20">Roland R05</a>.</p>

<iframe src="http://rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=signalleaf-20&o=1&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=ss_til&asins=B003IJ3WIW" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Podcasting is a great way to build an audience. It creates a
more intimate connection with listeners, vs written words.</p>

<p>Having multiple forms of media, such as book, blog, podcast,
etc, helps you build authority.</p>

<p>Podcasts introduce conversation instead of monologue. It&rsquo;s
easier to generate ideas, create something more valuable and
get more out of a conversation than a monologue, at times.</p>

<p>Choosing a name is hard &ndash; don&rsquo;t want to be too narrow, but
also want to identify and serve your audience, and deliver
value.</p>

<p>Getting feedback from trusted resources can give you confidence.
Even if you figure things out, find resources that teach you
and verify what you&rsquo;ve learned.</p>

<p>Podcast hosting eats up a lot of bandwidth. Be sure you have
a host that can handle the bandwidth. Find <a href="http://signalleaf.com">a podcast host</a>
when possible.</p>

<p>Average life of a podcast episode is 6 weeks. Bandwidth is
typically measured per month, but bandwidth for an episode can
be estimated from the 6 week download trend for past episodes.</p>

<p>Be careful of Feedburner and other free services. Feedburner
limits you to 512K feed size, and will drop episodes to keep
it small. FeedBlitz and other paid services won&rsquo;t introduce
this type of limit.</p>

<p>Your podcast needs RSS that is compatible with as many devices
and directories as possible. If your podcast hosting doesn&rsquo;t
ensure this, you will want to use a third party feed distribution
system like FeedBlitz.</p>

<p>Find a podcast / RSS host that provides the analytics you
need. <a href="http://signalleaf.com">SignalLeaf</a> gives you a breakdown of
RSS vs embeded player vs downloads, for traffic reports.</p>

<p>Trade iTunes directory reviews with other podcasters. Find podcasts
that you&rsquo;re interested in. Listen to a few episodes, then contact
the author and ask them to review your podcast in exchange for
you reviewing them.</p>

<p>You need a blog for your podcast, whether it&rsquo;s part of your
primary website or a separate blog. Write a post for each
episode with a short list of notes from the episode, at least.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/12/29/stop-waiting-for-the-right-equipment/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-29T06:48:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/12/29/stop-waiting-for-the-right-equipment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s not shortage of people and websites claiming that they
have &ldquo;the right equipment&rdquo; for you to get started with your
podcast. Even <a href="/equipment">this blog</a>
has an equipment list. And there seems to be a constant clammor
for more, all around the internet. I&rsquo;ll make it simple
for you, though: <strong>start with what you have, or pick something
quickly and move on</strong>.</p>

<p>Choosing the right
equipment or the right software is a waste of time right now.
You need to be more concerned with preparing and producing the
content of your podcast at this point.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The &ldquo;Right Equipment&rdquo; Is The Wrong Idea</h2>

<p>When you were learning to ride a bicycle, did your parents buy
you a $10,000 racing bike and enter you in the Tour de France?
When you were teaching your child to walk, did you buy them a
$300 pair of running shoes and ask them to run the Boston
Marathon? Of course not! The idea of that is ridiculous! Why,
then, do we expect people to buy new equipment and &ldquo;do it
right&rdquo; when they are starting out with podcasting?</p>

<p>Wait&hellip; you don&rsquo;t believe that this is happening? A casual search
on twitter reveals a number of people frustrated or waiting
because they don&rsquo;t have the right equipment, or asking about what
equipment they should get before they start.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/SignalLeaf">@SignalLeaf</a> I have been researching this for weeks now and everything I have read has said the complete opposite to not start cheap. Lol</p>&mdash; Michael Wright (@MrWrightNow78) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrWrightNow78/statuses/417126714884780032">December 29, 2013</a></blockquote>


<p>These tweets often look like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>I want to start a podcast, but I don&rsquo;t have the right equipment</p></blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote><p>What equipment do I need to start a podcast?</p></blockquote>

<p>These are questions on which people often get stuck. They assume
that you need a setup that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog_posts/recording-studio.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m going to let you in on a little secret&hellip; <strong>your podcast
&ldquo;studio&rdquo; is going to look more like this, when you start</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog_posts/laptop.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let me make this very clear: <strong>if you have a computer with a mic and an internet connection, you
already have the right equipment.</strong></p>

<h2>A Reward With No Effort</h2>

<p><a href="http://getupandcode.com">John Sonmez</a> summed up the problem quite nicely:</p>

<blockquote><p>Most people have it backwards.
They buy a treadmill thinking they will run because they spent $1k.
Or they buy new running shoes or a guitar.</p>

<p>The ones who actually succeed, run in old sneaker and tell themselves that when they have been running for 3 months they can buy real running shoes.
The ones who don&rsquo;t give up early are the ones who borrow a friend&rsquo;s piece of crap guitar and promise themselves that once they learn 10 songs they&rsquo;ll buy their own guitar.</p>

<p>When you already have the reward, you lack the motivation and you don&rsquo;t appreciate the instrument.
How do you appreciate $5,000 golf clubs if you never played with $50 golf clubs?</p></blockquote>

<p>The same is true of any reward, or any nice equipment for any purpose. Buying
the right equipment now is not a guarantee that you are going to produce a
great podcast. Wait until you have gone through the first experimental stages
and you know that you want to continue, having proven that you can produce
content.</p>

<p><strong>Once you have shown that you can produce content and get it delivered,
reward the effort with better equipment.</strong> But don&rsquo;t rely on the equipment to
make your job easy. It takes effort, no matter what equipment you are using.
The reason others make it look effortless, is not because of the equipment
they have. It is because they have struggled through
the learning curve and have mastered the tools and processes; they have earned
the equipment, the effortless production, and the audience.</p>

<p><strong>So get started now, with what you have.</strong> Earn the rewards of better equipment,
and build your audience and skillset through your efforts.</p>

<h2>A Computer, A Mic, And Internet Connection</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re using a computer.
Your computer may be called an iPhone or an iPad, it may be
an Android or a laptop of some sort. There are a lot of different
computers with a lot of different names. But they are all
computers and most of them can be used for recording your
podcast. <strong>The easiest computer to use for your first episode
is going to be a laptop, but nearly any computer and microphone
will work</strong>.</p>

<p>Speaking of microphones, that is something you need to
have in order to record your podcast. But,
nearly every computer comes with some sort of microphone built
in to it these days. If you have a headset with a mic, for gaming
or to use for Skyp and other chat services, that&rsquo;s even
better! You&rsquo;ll get better sound out of a headset than you will
out of a laptop mic. But <strong>I wouldn&rsquo;t let a laptop mic stop you
from starting your podcast</strong>. If it can record your voice, it can
be used to produce your podcast.</p>

<p>Lastly, <strong>you&rsquo;ll need access to the internet with a
fair upload speed</strong>. Smart phones, tablets, laptops and PCs of all sorts
have built-in internet connections that let us get online and
find everything we never wanted to know, and more! This same
internet connection is needed for uploading your podcast
episode to your podcast hosting service. But don&rsquo;t worry too
much about this. <strong>The connection is only really needed when you
are uploading your episode</strong>. You won&rsquo;t need a connection to
record a podcast, if you are only recording yourself or if
you have all of your guests in the same room as you.</p>

<h2>No More Excuses</h2>

<p>The truth is, <strong>a lot of people use the idea of not having &ldquo;the
right equipment&rdquo; as an excuse</strong> &ndash; even if they don&rsquo;t realize it.
It&rsquo;s easy to hide behind the
idea that you need to spend a lot of money on equipment. It&rsquo;s
easy to say that you&rsquo;ll get started once you save up enough to
get the right microphone. It&rsquo;s easy to put this off, because
it takes no effort. It takes no work. There is no committment
involved in not doing anything. Talk is cheap, and talking
about how you want to do this, but can&rsquo;t because you don&rsquo;t
the right equipment, is the cheapest of the cheap.</p>

<p><strong>The first podcast experience that you have is more about you
than anything else</strong>. It&rsquo;s about you getting comforable with the
idea of recording, of producing something, and putting your
thoughts out there for the world to hear. It&rsquo;s not about the
equipment that you do or don&rsquo;t have.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like <a href="http://jennybrewster.com/podcasting-equipment/">Jenny Brewster</a>
said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Record in the Cupboard if that’s where you’re happy</p></blockquote>

<p>Sure, if you happen to have
some equipment already, it might make your first episode sound
better. But it&rsquo;s not about the quality, when you&rsquo;re starting
out. <strong>Starting is all about getting up and running quickly.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, there is at a bare minimum amount of
equipment that you do need. The good news is that you
have everything you need, already.</p>

<h2>Published And Flawed Is Better Than Not Published</h2>

<p>This really is the point of what I&rsquo;m trying to say: it&rsquo;s far
better to have published a flawed podcast with less than perfect
audio quality, than to wait for the right equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Podcasting is like any other skill &ndash; it takes practices, not
money, to get good at it</strong>. Producing your first podcast may
feel awkward, but this is normal. Everyone goes through this
the first time they record something. But you&rsquo;ll find
that over time, your podcast quality will naturally improve.
You&rsquo;ll get better at speaking. You&rsquo;ll get better at positioning
the microphone. You&rsquo;ll be become more comfortable, and you&rsquo;ll
enjoy the process much more.</p>

<p><em>Don&rsquo;t wait for the right equipment. Use the equipment that you
have right now, and get started!</em></p>
