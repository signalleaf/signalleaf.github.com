    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was talking with someone via email, recently, about a podcast
they are starting. This person clearly had all of the right tools
and skills for recording and editing the podcast, as they were
part of a band that has recorded and released albums. During the
conversation, I asked if they already had a plan for how they
were going to host the podcast. The response I got was not what
I expected:</p>

<blockquote><p>we have not yet gotten to the question of hosting the podcast yet.
i was assuming we would do it though iTunes, but i haven&rsquo;t thought farther than that.</p></blockquote>

<p>While I was surprised at first, this seems to be an
unfortunately common mistake. After all, your subscribers find
you through iTunes, right? So isn&rsquo;t that where you host your
podcast?</p>

<h2>So, iTunes Won&rsquo;t Host My Podcast?</h2>

<p>I can understand this person&rsquo;s perspective on iTunes. They
are in a band. This band sells music through iTunes. iTunes
hosts the audio files for those song and album sales. Why wouldn&rsquo;t
it work the same way with podcasts?</p>

<p>Sorry, no &ndash; podcasts work a bit different than other audio, in
distribution and hosting. Instead of uploading podcast episodes
directly to iTunes, it is only a network for finding and
subscribing to podcast RSS feeds.</p>

<h2>iTunes And Google Maps</h2>

<p>Think of it like Google Maps&hellip; you can quickly and easily find
an address and a business on Google maps, but Google maps won&rsquo;t
take you there. You have to walk, drive, fly, or otherwise get
yourself to the real location that Google maps showed you.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.signalleaf.com/images/blog_posts/google-maps.png" width="400"></p>

<p>Podcasts in iTunes work the same way. iTunes lists your podcast
like Google maps lists a business with an address and phone
number. You can quickly and easily find a podcast that iTunes
has listed, but your computer is only find the address and
description of the podcast. The computer then has to travel to
the actual podcast location &ndash;  where the RSS feed is hosted.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.signalleaf.com/images/blog_posts/getupandcode.png" width="400"></p>

<p>When you subscribe to a podcast through iTunes, the podcast
listing that you found in iTunes was only the map for your
computer to find the actual podcast and subscribe to it.</p>

<p>In the case of <a href="http://getupandcode.com">Get Up And Code</a>, as
shown in the above screenshot, your computer will be redirected
to the RSS feed hosted at <a href="http://GetUpAndCode.com">http://GetUpAndCode.com</a> to create the
subscription and to get updates from their RSS feed.</p>

<h2>So, How <em>Do</em> I Host My Podcast?</h2>

<p>You can&rsquo;t host your podcast directly in iTunes, but there are
plenty of services and other options for hosting. The choices
come down to a few basic things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do it all yourself</li>
<li>Get a podcasting plugin for a blogging platform</li>
<li>Pay for a podcast hosting service</li>
</ul>


<h4>DIY</h4>

<p>The &ldquo;do-it-yourself&rdquo; crowd tends to be the software developer and
techie person that can build the software and services needed
for hosting. If you&rsquo;re not a software developer, I don&rsquo;t recommend
this path. If you <em>are</em> a software developer, I still don&rsquo;t
recommend this path. It&rsquo;s tedious and painful, and wrought with
problems.</p>

<h4>Blogging Plugins</h4>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an avid blogger and you&rsquo;re already deeply entrenched
in to WordPress or any of the other major blogging platforms, you
can find plugins to make podcast hosting easy. You can upload a
file, use the <code>[audio]</code> tag in your post and be done with it. But
unless you&rsquo;re hosting your own servers and/or uploading your
episodes to another service, you&rsquo;re probably going to run in to
bandwidth and other limitations.</p>

<p>Everyone that I have spoken to,
that says they are hosting a podcast on WordPress, says they
eventually ran in to problems. It can be done for small podcasts,
and it can be cheap and easy. But with substantial growth in the
populartiy of the podcast comes potential for substantial cost
and problems.</p>

<h4>Podcast Hosting Services</h4>

<p>The last option listed, paying for a podcast host, is going to
be the best option for any serious podcast. You don&rsquo;t want to
manage file security. You don&rsquo;t want to deal with server
configuration. You don&rsquo;t want to build traffic reports, manually.
You just want to podcast.</p>

<p>There are a lot of options for hosting your podcast episodes,
including <a href="http://signalleaf.com">SignalLeaf</a>. I don&rsquo;t claim
to be the one-and-only solution, or the one that fits everyone&rsquo;s
needs. I do have a very simple, very flexible solution, though.
If you&rsquo;re looking for a podcast host that focuses solely on
providing storage, bandwidth, RSS feed generation and traffic
analysis, then <a href="http://signalleaf.com">SignalLeaf</a> is probably
a good choice for you.</p>

provies, though, I still want to help you. I want to understand
your needs &ndash; what you&rsquo;re doing with your podcast, what blogging
platform or existing website you already have, etc. I want to
make sure you find the right solution, not just the
&ldquo;everyone is using them&rdquo; solution.</p>
