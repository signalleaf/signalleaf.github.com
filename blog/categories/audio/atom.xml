    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Noise from ventilation systems, cars driving down the street,
keeping yourself warm with a heater or even the hum of
flourescent lighting &ndash; these are all sources of background
noise that can make or break your audio quality.</p>

<p>Having a
constant hum or buzz in the background can be very distracting
and cause people to turn away from your podcast. Fortunately,
the <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> audio
editing app can help you get rid of the noise in a few&hellip;
not quite so straight forward steps. Not to worry, though &ndash;
while the 2 step process may be a little bit odd when you
first see it, it is not difficult to understand or accomplish.</p>

<h2>The Video</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve put together a short video to demonstrate how to use
Audacity to clean up your audio. It&rsquo;s 7 minutes of step by
step instructions, including a demonstration of the original
audio and the cleaned up audio. Check it out on
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT-Yk9zHKf4">my Youtube channel</a>,
or watch it here, embedded in this blog post.</p>

<h2>The Audio</h2>

<p>In addition to the video on how to use Audacity to clean up
your audio, I&rsquo;ve also got two podcast episodes to demonstrate
the difference.</p>

<h4>The Original</h4>

<p>In this original source file, you will hear a constant hum
in the background, from a ventilation intake right outside of
my office. You may have to turn up the volume a bit to hear
it, but it is unmistakably there.</p>

<iframe src="http://media.signalleaf.com/player/Signals-And-Leaves-Special-Editions/52ebcc6c4d17c40200000010/" width="500" height="70" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Cleaned Up</h4>

<p>Now in this second version of the same audio file, I&rsquo;ve used
Audacity to clean up the background noise. The effect is
dramatic &ndash; the noise is gone during the quiet periods of the
episode. But, it is not perfect. If you have high quality
headphones, you will be able to hear a little bit of
distortion or noise in the low-end frequencies while I am
speaking. You may not hear it if your headset is not of
high enough quality, or if there is too much noise where you
are listening, but it is there.</p>

<iframe src="http://media.signalleaf.com/player/Signals-And-Leaves-Special-Editions/52ebccbd4d17c40200000012/" width="500" height="70" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Additional Cleanup?</h4>

<p>Note that it is possible to do additional cleanup of the
remaining low frequency noise during my speaking. I left this
as-is, though, to demonstrate some of the limitations of what
the noise removal tool are. I may, at some other point, show
how to do additional processing to clean this up a bit more,
but that will be another post for another time.</p>

<h2>Professional Audio Cleanup</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s fairly simple to add at least a modest amount of audio
clean to your process, as you&rsquo;ve seen here. However, there
are some limitations to what Audacity can do, and it does take
a lot of practice and experience to really get things perfect.
You may find yourself in a situation where you don&rsquo;t have time
to learn all the tricks, or you need some additional expertise
in cleaning up and doing post-production audio work. If that&rsquo;s
the case, you might want to look in to an audio production
service such as <a href="http://www.podcastfasttrack.com/">PodcastFastTrac</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.podcastfasttrack.com/"><img src="/images/blog_posts/podcastfasttrack.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>PodcastFastTrack is a service that can handle all of your
podcast production needs, including editing, splicing in music
and intros, audio clean up and more. <strong>The combination of
post-production work from PodcastFastTrack, plus hosting
services from <a href="http://signalleaf.com">SignalLeaf.com</a></strong> may be
just what you need to keep yourself production and focused on
your podcast, instead of having to worry about the technical
and production side of thigs.</p>

    <id>http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/12/31/learn-about-mics-from-mike-and-mike</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was watching <a href="http://espn.go.com/espnradio/show?showId=mikeandmike">Mike And Mike</a>
recently (with a guest host in this case, I think), and paying attention to
the microphones they were using. At
some point in watching them, I noticed how incredibly close they were
to their mics so I snapped a couple of photos from my phone. There&rsquo;s a
few interesting things you can learn from watching these guys talk, to
help you learn better mic position for yourself, among other things.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog_posts/mike-and-mike.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Eat The Mic</h2>

<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll notice is that they are basically eating the
mic, the entire time. They keep the mic right next to their mouth the
entire time that they are talking, and even when they are not talking.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog_posts/mike-and-mike-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is an important point to make. Keeping your mouth close to the
mic gives you the best possible audio quality for your individual voice.
It will pick up the high end and low end better than if you were
further away, and it will also allow you to keep the room noise to
a minimum.</p>

<p>When you have the mic close to your mouth, you need to keep the input
level low, so you don&rsquo;t get distortion. Keeping the input level low
means the mic will pick up less noise from the room. Even if you&rsquo;re in
a room full of echo, you can reduce this by eating the mic.</p>

<h4>On Not Eating The Mic</h4>

<p>In a previous post / podcast episode, I talked about keeping the mic
around 4 inches away from my mouth. This is what I tend to do, as it&rsquo;s
what I learned in my audio engineering courses in college. I&rsquo;ve seen
more and more people getting the mic right up to their mouth, over the
years, though.</p>

<p>Bringing your mouth up to the mic like this can have some drawbacks, such
as excessive mouth noises. I tend to have a problem with this, personally,
 but not everyone does. Do some tests. Practice a bit. See if this type
of positioning works for you.</p>

<h2>Chew With Your Molars</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s an important aspect of mic position, when keeping the mic close
to your face. These hosts are not putting mic directly in front of their mouth.
Rather, they are almost always putting
the mic off to the side of their mouth, with the mic diaphragm pointing in to
their mouth.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog_posts/mike-and-mike-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Doing this keep the pops from your P and T sounds down to a minimum. When
you say words with strong P and T sounds, there is a small burst of air
that comes out of your mouth. If that burst of air hits the diaphragm
directly, you will get a loud booming sound or pop in the audio. This is
incredibly distracting, at minimum, and worse if the audio distorts because
of it. Keeping the mic to the side of your mouth cuts this down incredibly.</p>

<h4>Where&rsquo;s The Pop Screen?</h4>

<p>Most recording studios use a pop screen to cut down the pops from P and T
sounds, but there isn&rsquo;t one on these mic sets. There is either a pop screen
built in to the mic, or they are using external audio equipment to squash
the pops when they do happen.</p>

<p>In this case, they are using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Z7LLQ0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000Z7LLQ0&linkCode=as2&tag=signalleaf-20">Electro Voice RE-20 Cardioid Microphone</a>
which does have a pop filter built in to it.</p>

<h2>Movement Doesn&rsquo;t Decrease Quality</h2>

<p>If you watch a video of the hosts, you&rsquo;ll notice that they do move around
a bit when they get excited or passionate about something. Yet when they do
this, the quality of audio &ndash; including the volume &ndash; does not diminish. This
is the result of a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Audio Compression</li>
<li>Not moving more than a few inches away</li>
</ul>


<p>Audio compression, <a href="http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/12/10/audio-vs-file-compression/">as I&rsquo;ve talked about before</a>,
is an important aspect of
audio quality. Keeping the high volume and low volume portions of your
podcast relatively close in volume is going to improve the over-all perception
of quality in your audio. Listeners won&rsquo;t be turning the volume up to hear
things, and then blowing their ear drums out when it gets loud again.</p>

<p>But even the best audio compression can&rsquo;t correct you moving too far away
from the mic. You need to stay within a small distance of the mic, even when
you do get animated. Staying within a small range of your mic, no matter
your average distance, is important. It allows you to add a reasonable
amount of compression to your audio, and not destroy the quality of the audio.</p>

<h2>Shock Mounts</h2>

<p>During the portions of the broadcast where the camera is pulled away from the
hosts, you can often see the hosts banging their hands on the desk &ndash; but you
will never hear those bangs in the audio. A good shock mount, which you can
clearly see the micrphones mounted in, will cut the desk and arm noise from
your audio. You&rsquo;ll be able to bang on the desk or mic stand a bit, and
you won&rsquo;t have that noise transferring through the mic stand in to the mic
itself.</p>

<h2>Learn From The Pros</h2>

<p>Paying attenting to your favorite broadcasters can yield some great tips on
how to improve your own mic position and audio quality. The more you watch others,
the more you&rsquo;ll be able to pick out the techniques and tips from body
position and mic position and mount. It&rsquo;s more difficult to know what the
back-end electronics look like, of course, but there certainly are plenty of
places where you can find this info &ndash; it&rsquo;s usually just a few clicks
 away on your favorite search egine.</p>
