&ldquo;<a href="http://blog.signalleaf.com/how-to-podcast">Prepare, Produce, Publish: Your First Podcast In 3 Easy Steps!</a>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This book is all about getting you started in the world of
podcasting. From the equipment that you need (<em>and don&rsquo;t need!</em>)
to using Audacity for recording your first episode, and how
to publish your podcast through a hosting service, this book
covers it all for for the new podcaster!</p>

<h2>Early Bird Pricing And Updates</h2>

<p>This ebook is currently a work in progress. That means it is
not yet complete, but it still provides a ton of value as-is.
That also means that <strong>you, dear podcaster, get to purchase the
book at a discounted price!</strong> Better hurry, though&hellip; this
discount won&rsquo;t last forever! Once I&rsquo;ve got the book completed,
the price will jump!</p>

<p>In addition to getting it cheaper, you will also get all of
the updates, free! As soon as I publish an update to the book
you will have it available in your downloads, guaranteed. That
means you&rsquo;ll get all of the step by step instructions, tips
and tricks to publish your podcast as I write them!</p>
