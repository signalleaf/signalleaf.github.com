    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s not shortage of people and websites claiming that they
have &ldquo;the right equipment&rdquo; for you to get started with your
podcast. Even <a href="http://blog.signalleaf.com/equipment">this blog</a>
has an equipment list. And there seems to be a constant clammor
for more, all around the internet. I&rsquo;ll make it simple
for you, though: <strong>start with what you have, or pick something
quickly and move on</strong>.</p>

<p>Choosing the right
equipment or the right software is a waste of time right now.
You need to be more concerned with preparing and producing the
content of your podcast at this point.</p>

<h2>The &ldquo;Right Equipment&rdquo; Is The Wrong Idea</h2>

<p>When you were learning to ride a bicycle, did your parents buy
you a $10,000 racing bike and enter you in the Tour de France?
When you were teaching your child to walk, did you buy them a
$300 pair of running shoes and ask them to run the Boston
Marathon? Of course not! The idea of that is ridiculous! Why,
then, do we expect people to buy new equipment and &ldquo;do it
right&rdquo; when they are starting out with podcasting?</p>

<p>Wait&hellip; you don&rsquo;t believe that this is happening? A casual search
on twitter reveals a number of people frustrated or waiting
because they don&rsquo;t have the right equipment, or asking about what
equipment they should get before they start.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/SignalLeaf">@SignalLeaf</a> I have been researching this for weeks now and everything I have read has said the complete opposite to not start cheap. Lol</p>&mdash; Michael Wright (@MrWrightNow78) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrWrightNow78/statuses/417126714884780032">December 29, 2013</a></blockquote>


<p>These tweets often look like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>I want to start a podcast, but I don&rsquo;t have the right equipment</p></blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote><p>What equipment do I need to start a podcast?</p></blockquote>

<p>These are questions on which people often get stuck. They assume
that you need a setup that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.signalleaf.com/images/blog_posts/recording-studio.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m going to let you in on a little secret&hellip; <strong>your podcast
&ldquo;studio&rdquo; is going to look more like this, when you start</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.signalleaf.com/images/blog_posts/laptop.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let me make this very clear: <strong>if you have a computer with a mic and an internet connection, you
already have the right equipment.</strong></p>

<h2>A Reward With No Effort</h2>

<p><a href="http://getupandcode.com">John Sonmez</a> summed up the problem quite nicely:</p>

<blockquote><p>Most people have it backwards.
They buy a treadmill thinking they will run because they spent $1k.
Or they buy new running shoes or a guitar.</p>

<p>The ones who actually succeed, run in old sneaker and tell themselves that when they have been running for 3 months they can buy real running shoes.
The ones who don&rsquo;t give up early are the ones who borrow a friend&rsquo;s piece of crap guitar and promise themselves that once they learn 10 songs they&rsquo;ll buy their own guitar.</p>

<p>When you already have the reward, you lack the motivation and you don&rsquo;t appreciate the instrument.
How do you appreciate $5,000 golf clubs if you never played with $50 golf clubs?</p></blockquote>

<p>The same is true of any reward, or any nice equipment for any purpose. Buying
the right equipment now is not a guarantee that you are going to produce a
great podcast. Wait until you have gone through the first experimental stages
and you know that you want to continue, having proven that you can produce
content.</p>

<p><strong>Once you have shown that you can produce content and get it delivered,
reward the effort with better equipment.</strong> But don&rsquo;t rely on the equipment to
make your job easy. It takes effort, no matter what equipment you are using.
The reason others make it look effortless, is not because of the equipment
they have. It is because they have struggled through
the learning curve and have mastered the tools and processes; they have earned
the equipment, the effortless production, and the audience.</p>

<p><strong>So get started now, with what you have.</strong> Earn the rewards of better equipment,
and build your audience and skillset through your efforts.</p>

<h2>A Computer, A Mic, And Internet Connection</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re using a computer.
Your computer may be called an iPhone or an iPad, it may be
an Android or a laptop of some sort. There are a lot of different
computers with a lot of different names. But they are all
computers and most of them can be used for recording your
podcast. <strong>The easiest computer to use for your first episode
is going to be a laptop, but nearly any computer and microphone
will work</strong>.</p>

<p>Speaking of microphones, that is something you need to
have in order to record your podcast. But,
nearly every computer comes with some sort of microphone built
in to it these days. If you have a headset with a mic, for gaming
or to use for Skyp and other chat services, that&rsquo;s even
better! You&rsquo;ll get better sound out of a headset than you will
out of a laptop mic. But <strong>I wouldn&rsquo;t let a laptop mic stop you
from starting your podcast</strong>. If it can record your voice, it can
be used to produce your podcast.</p>

<p>Lastly, <strong>you&rsquo;ll need access to the internet with a
fair upload speed</strong>. Smart phones, tablets, laptops and PCs of all sorts
have built-in internet connections that let us get online and
find everything we never wanted to know, and more! This same
internet connection is needed for uploading your podcast
episode to your podcast hosting service. But don&rsquo;t worry too
much about this. <strong>The connection is only really needed when you
are uploading your episode</strong>. You won&rsquo;t need a connection to
record a podcast, if you are only recording yourself or if
you have all of your guests in the same room as you.</p>

<h2>No More Excuses</h2>

<p>The truth is, <strong>a lot of people use the idea of not having &ldquo;the
right equipment&rdquo; as an excuse</strong> &ndash; even if they don&rsquo;t realize it.
It&rsquo;s easy to hide behind the
idea that you need to spend a lot of money on equipment. It&rsquo;s
easy to say that you&rsquo;ll get started once you save up enough to
get the right microphone. It&rsquo;s easy to put this off, because
it takes no effort. It takes no work. There is no committment
involved in not doing anything. Talk is cheap, and talking
about how you want to do this, but can&rsquo;t because you don&rsquo;t
the right equipment, is the cheapest of the cheap.</p>

<p><strong>The first podcast experience that you have is more about you
than anything else</strong>. It&rsquo;s about you getting comforable with the
idea of recording, of producing something, and putting your
thoughts out there for the world to hear. It&rsquo;s not about the
equipment that you do or don&rsquo;t have.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like <a href="http://jennybrewster.com/podcasting-equipment/">Jenny Brewster</a>
said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Record in the Cupboard if that’s where you’re happy</p></blockquote>

<p>Sure, if you happen to have
some equipment already, it might make your first episode sound
better. But it&rsquo;s not about the quality, when you&rsquo;re starting
out. <strong>Starting is all about getting up and running quickly.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, there is at a bare minimum amount of
equipment that you do need. The good news is that you
have everything you need, already.</p>

<h2>Published And Flawed Is Better Than Not Published</h2>

<p>This really is the point of what I&rsquo;m trying to say: it&rsquo;s far
better to have published a flawed podcast with less than perfect
audio quality, than to wait for the right equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Podcasting is like any other skill &ndash; it takes practices, not
money, to get good at it</strong>. Producing your first podcast may
feel awkward, but this is normal. Everyone goes through this
the first time they record something. But you&rsquo;ll find
that over time, your podcast quality will naturally improve.
You&rsquo;ll get better at speaking. You&rsquo;ll get better at positioning
the microphone. You&rsquo;ll be become more comfortable, and you&rsquo;ll
enjoy the process much more.</p>

<p><em>Don&rsquo;t wait for the right equipment. Use the equipment that you
have right now, and get started!</em></p>

    <link href="http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/12/18/mp3-bit-rates/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-18T07:54:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/12/18/mp3-bit-rates</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/12/10/audio-vs-file-compression/">a previous blog post</a>
I talked about the need for both file and audio compression
on your podcasts. At the end of that post, I linked out to
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scottburton11/3222152">an article from Scott Burton on audio compression</a>,
but did not have any information on MP3 file compression at
the time.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.signalleaf.com/images/blog_posts/c-clamp-mp3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Well, I have all the MP3 file compression information, along with
bit rates and my own judgement on audio quality vs file size now.
And you might be surprised at the results! I know I was!</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The Episode Content And Bit Rates</h2>

<p>I recorded a 32 minute podcast episode that contains 2 things:</p>

<ol>
<li>A musical introduction</li>
<li>A lengty spoken track</li>
</ol>


<p>The musical introduction takes not quite a minute, with the
spoken audio taking up the rest of the 32 minutes. The spoken
audio is not a complete episode, however. It is only a 1+
minute description of the episode&rsquo;s purpose, repeated over
and over and over again to get a podcast episode of
approximately average length. In other words, <strong>don&rsquo;t bother
listening past the first minute and a half</strong>. It just repeats
for a long time to make the point of file size vs content
length.</p>

<p>After recording the episode, I exported it under 10
separate bit rate settings, using <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Aadacity</a>.
With all of these bit rate exports, I create a special
podcast on SignalLeaf just for these episodes. You can
<a href="http://www.signalleaf.com/podcasts/52b10a635b56000200000011/rss">subscribe to the podcast RSS feed</a>
and listen to each of the episodes in iTunes and other
podcast players, or you can use the embedded players here.</p>

<h2>Constant Bit Rate Versions</h2>

<p>These episodes were exported at a constant bit rate &ndash; a rate that stays the same
throughout the entire encoding, regardless of the amount of data that there is to
encode.</p>

<h4>16K Constant</h4>

<iframe src="http://www.signalleaf.com/embed/52b10a635b56000200000011/52b10ade4cacd40200000050/" width="500" height="70" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Episode exported at 16K Constant bit rate with 20K sampling (max supported by 16K file bit rate). The effect is quite horrible. Everything sounds muffled, warbly, and like its in a tin can with ear muffs. The file is quite small, at 3.9Megs, though.</p>

<h4>32K Constant</h4>

<iframe src="http://www.signalleaf.com/embed/52b10a635b56000200000011/52b10cf04cacd40200000051/" width="500" height="70" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Episode exported at 32K Constant bit rate with 44.1K sampling. The effect is still pretty bad. Everything sounds warbly and slightly muffled, though not as bad as the 16K file. The highs are especially off, and a lot of the stereo effect in the opening music is gone. The file is still pretty small, at 7.7Megs.</p>

<h4>64K Constant</h4>

<iframe src="http://www.signalleaf.com/embed/52b10a635b56000200000011/52b10d824cacd40200000053/" width="500" height="70" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Episode exported at 64K Constant bit rate with 44.1K sampling. The quality drop in this file is negligible. There are some points in the opening music where some slight warbles can be heard on the high end sounds. Additional guitar sounds and other instruments tend to have a more pronounced warbled sound at this bit rate. The file size is still quite reasonable and may be considered &ldquo;small&rdquo; by some standards, at 15.5Megs.</p>

<h4>128K Constant</h4>

<iframe src="http://www.signalleaf.com/embed/52b10a635b56000200000011/52b10e6e5b56000200000017/" width="500" height="70" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Episode exported at 128K Constant bit rate with 44.1K sampling. The net effect of this bit rate is no noticeable degradation in audio quality, throughout the podcast episode. If additional instrumentation were present, there would be little to no loss of audio quality. The quality comes at a trade off in file size, though, with the file being 31Megs in size. This size is hardly acceptable for a podcast that is only 32 minutes in length.</p>

<h4>256K Constant</h4>

<iframe src="http://www.signalleaf.com/embed/52b10a635b56000200000011/52b110185b56000200000018/" width="500" height="70" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Episode exported at 256K Constant bit rate with 44.1K sampling. At 62 megs, this file size is completely unacceptable for distributing a podcast of only 32 minutes in length. The sound quality, however, is near impeccable. There is little chance that anyone would be able to pick up any distortions in the quality of audio.</p>

<h2>Variable Bit Rate Versions</h2>

<p>Variable bit rate encoding allows the bit rate to change based on the amount of information
that needs to be encoded. If there is less audio signal to encode, the bit rate goes down.
If there is more, it goes up. This can reduce the file size while still maintaining quality,
in many cases.</p>

<h4>48K &ndash; 85K Variable</h4>

<iframe src="http://www.signalleaf.com/embed/52b10a635b56000200000011/52b111a44cacd40200000059/" width="500" height="70" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Exported at 48K-85K Variable bit rate with 44.1K sampling. There is very little distortion in this file, even in the musical introduction. A direct comparison of the 64K Constant bit rate yields a slight increase in audio quality over that export. The file size, in comparison, dropped from 15.5Megs down to 13Megs. The audio quality vs file size at this bit rate is quite nice.</p>

<h4>80K &ndash; 120K Variable</h4>

<iframe src="http://www.signalleaf.com/embed/52b10a635b56000200000011/52b115e44cacd4020000005a/" width="500" height="70" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Exported at 80K-120K Variable bit rate with 44.1K sampling. There is little to no perceivable distortion in this audio even in the musical introduction. A larger assortment of musical instruments comprising a full band or orchestra may exhibit some minor issues, but not enough to cause serious displeasure. A direct comparison of the 128K Constant bit rate yields approximately the same audio quality, though it is technically slightly less. The file size, in comparison, dropped from 31Megs down to 18.4Megs for a mostly spoken audio file. The audio quality vs file size at this bit rate is quite nice.</p>

<h4>145K &ndash; 185K Variable</h4>

<iframe src="http://www.signalleaf.com/embed/52b10a635b56000200000011/52b117d94cacd4020000005c/" width="500" height="70" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Exported at 145K-185K Variable bit rate with 44.1K sampling. There is little to no perceivable distortion in this audio even in the musical introduction. A larger assortment of musical instruments comprising a full band or orchestra may exhibit some minor issues, but not enough to cause serious displeasure. A direct comparison of the 128K Constant bit rate yields a technically higher quality audio file, but with little perceivable difference (if any). The file size, in comparison, dropped from 31Megs down to 26Megs for a mostly spoken audio file. The audio quality vs file size at this bit rate is acceptable for music based podcasts, but may be slightly larger than desired for spoken podcasts.</p>

<h4>170K &ndash; 210K Variable</h4>

<iframe src="http://www.signalleaf.com/embed/52b10a635b56000200000011/52b119354cacd4020000005e/" width="500" height="70" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Exported at 170K-210K Variable bit rate with 44.1K sampling. There is little to no perceivable distortion in this audio even in the musical introduction. A larger assortment of musical instruments comprising a full band or orchestra should not exhibit any noticeable distortion, except in extreme cases. A direct comparison of the 128K Constant bit rate yields a higher quality that is imperceptibly improved with a spoken podcast. A full orchestra or other large arrangement of instruments may show some perceived improvements. The file size, in comparison, dropped from 31Megs down to 30.4Megs for a mostly spoken audio file &ndash; a negligible difference, at best. The audio quality vs file size at this bit rate may be acceptable for music based podcasts, but is too large for spoken podcasts.</p>

<h4>220K &ndash; 260K Variable</h4>

<iframe src="http://www.signalleaf.com/embed/52b10a635b56000200000011/52b11a315b56000200000022/" width="500" height="70" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Exported at 220K-260K Variable bit rate with 44.1K sampling. Good luck finding any perceivable audio quality problems with this one. A direct comparison of the 256K Constant bit rate yields approximately the same audio quality, though it is technically slightly less. The file size, in comparison, dropped from 62Megs down to 39.2Megs for a mostly spoken audio file &ndash; a significant reduction. The audio quality vs file size at this bit rate is not acceptable for streaming. The file is simply too large for the amount of content contained within it.</p>

<h2>The (Somewhat Surprising) Results</h2>

<p>As you would expect, the low-end results of the 16K bit rate
are attrocious. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the ridiculously small
file size, this would never even be an option. In fact, I&rsquo;m
going to call it not an option anyways, in spite of the file
size. The audio quality is simply horrible. I wouldn&rsquo;t inflict
that on anyone.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always known that a variable bit rate .mp3 file was going
to be smaller, but I had never directly compared the file size
and audio quality with a constant/variable counterpart before.
The ability to keep roughly the same file size while increasing
the over-all quality was a nice effect when comparing 64K Constant
to 80-120K Variable, for example. The Variable is slightly
larger, but with the increase of quality and negligible file size
gain, this was a huge win for variable bit rates!</p>

<p>The other surprising result is how little difference there is,
if there is any perceivable difference, between 128K and
anything above it. At least with spoken podcasts I don&rsquo;t see
any need to ever use anything above 128K Constant rate, or
the near equivalent quality of 80K-120K Variable rate.</p>

<h2>Revised Recommendation: 96K or 128K Constant Bit Rate</h2>

<p>I had originally written this post to recommend 80K-120K
Variable Bit rate, based on the audio quality and file size.
But I need to revise that based on some conversation with
<a href="http://thepodcastersstudio.com/">Ray Ortega</a> and Rob Walch
(from <a href="http://libsyn.com">LibSyn</a>) over on <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DerickBailey/posts/AWQvwWf5c4n">my Google+ post</a>.</p>

<p>Rob points out several problems with audio players as recent
as IOS6, and links to several posts where problems and solutions
are discussed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=4249">MP3 Export, CBR=Good VBR=Bad Length</a> (from the Audacity forums)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/doc/technotes/">SoundManager 2: Technical Nodes</a></li>
</ul>


<p>In the SoundManager 2 note, specifically, Rob points out the
following for the SoundManager 2, HTML5 player.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;MP3 Format Caveats</p>

<p>Additionally, some very low and very high bitrate MP3s, and Variable Bitrate (VBR) MP3s may play either too quickly or too slowly (see &ldquo;the chipmunk problem&rdquo;); if you are encountering this issue, try re-encoding at a different bitrate (between 64 kbps and 192 kbps, for example.) Using Constant Bitrate (CBR) encoding may also alleviate this problem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Given that, I&rsquo;m going to revise my recommendation:</p>

<p><strong>Use 128K or 96K Constant Bit Rate</strong> unless you have a good
reason not to.</p>

<h4>On Variable Bit Rates</h4>

<p>Even after revising my recommendation, I&rsquo;m going to leave
this note here, as to what my original recommendation was. At
the very least, it will let you the reader see where I was
coming from originally vs now.</p>

<blockquote><p>If I were going to recommend one signal bit rate to encode
your podcast .mp3 files, it would be 80K-120K Variable bit
rate. The audio quality vs file size is superb, with little
to not distortion or wobbles in a mostly spoken podcast.</p>

<p>If you press me hard enough, I&rsquo;ll admit that I want the
145K-185K Variable rate for music based podcasts. The additional
layers of sound found in music can present some warbles
and distortion on the high end frequencies at lower rates.
Honestly it&rsquo;s probably not going to bother anyong at the
80K &ndash; 120K rate, but I prefer to be safe when it comes to
my music encoding.</p></blockquote>

<p>And even at this, there are podcasters out there who have
switched over to variable bit rates with no issues.
<a href="https://twitter.com/jongalloway">John Galloway</a>
for example, has been serving more than 9,000 listeners of
his podcast in variable bit rate for over a year.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/SignalLeaf">@SignalLeaf</a> Thanks. I was using CBR until last year for that reason, but switched to VBR and didn&#39;t get one complaint. Roughly 9k listeners.</p>&mdash; Jon Galloway (@jongalloway) <a href="https://twitter.com/jongalloway/statuses/414159229755219968">December 20, 2013</a></blockquote>


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/SignalLeaf">@SignalLeaf</a> I think the turnover rate in MP3 players - esp with phones - is high enough that it&#39;s no longer an issue.</p>&mdash; Jon Galloway (@jongalloway) <a href="https://twitter.com/jongalloway/statuses/414159430633021440">December 20, 2013</a></blockquote>

<h2>One Size Does Not Fit All</h2>

<p>Clearly there is some dispute over the constant bit rate
vs variable bit rate. I&rsquo;m inclined to lean toward what
Rob Walch from LibSyn is saying at this point. But I&rsquo;m also
a technologist that understands the curve of old technology
falling off the market and being replaced by newer standards.
In the end, you should compress your audio files according to
your podcast needs, weighing file size vs audio quality and
available bandwidth. Whether this means constant or variable
bit rates is up to you.</p>

<p>Happy podcasting, all you Signalers!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/12/10/audio-vs-file-compression/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-10T20:29:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/12/10/audio-vs-file-compression</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bandwidth for streaming podcasts is expensive, and using it
up with podcast audio that is too quiet, then too loud, then
too quiet again is a giant waste of money. <strong>Fear not!</strong> Just
toss in a little bit of compression and you can <strong>save money,
conserve bandwidth, and please the ears of your listeners</strong>
all at the same time.</p>

<p>But&hellip; audio compression, or file compression? Wait, what&rsquo;s
the difference? I&rsquo;m already exporting to .mp3 files, and
they&rsquo;re compressed, right? Yes, but that&rsquo;s file compression.
Audio compression is something entirely different, and is
just as important. Knowing when you have enough compression
of both kinds is also important, and knowing what they are
and how they affect your podcast is critical.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>File Compression</h2>

<p>Nearly everyone that knows how to use a computer is familiar
with file compression. You&rsquo;ve seen it and its effects more
times than you can count. Ever had a .zip file? Or a .jpg
file (hint: you&rsquo;re looking at some on this site)? These file
extensions are indications of file compression protocols.
Podcasts that use .mp3 files also use compression. Each of
these compression types offers something different, and
specialized, and there are still hundreds (thousands?) of
other file compression types around.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.signalleaf.com/images/blog_posts/mp3-export-settings.png"></p>

<p>Delivering audio in a .mp3 file allows files to be much
smaller than other uncompressed formats. But this comes at
a cost. The mp3 format uses a lossy compression algorithm:
a means of compression that reduces the audio quality in order
to reduce the amount of information being stored in the file.
Smaller files come from less information being stored.</p>

<h4>How Much File Compression?</h4>

<p>The effect of a .mp3 file saved at a very low bit rate
is terrible sounding audio in some cases, but not in others.
This is what makes compression somewhat tricky.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re
recording human voices for a podcast, for example, you can
get away with a much lower quality file (lower bit rate).
There isn&rsquo;t a lot of dynamic range of content, or overlapping
content in a human voice &ndash; even with multiple people
speaking at the same time.</p>

<p>When recording musical
instruments, however, low quality audio becomes apparent
very quickly. If you choose a low bit rate for music,
high pitch sounds become distorted in odd ways
and low pitch sounds become muffled and muted. Mid range
sounds can do ok, still, but get mixed up with each other when
multiple instruments are in the same frequency range.  Music
demands a higher bit rate, but not alway the highest.</p>

<h4>Avoid &ldquo;A Copy Of A Copy&rdquo; Syndrome</h4>

<p>One thing you also need to be aware of: if you&rsquo;re importing
existing audio files in to your screencast, be sure they are
high quality to start with.</p>

<p>Why, you might ask? Have you ever made a photocopy of a
photocopy of a photocopy? Compressing already compressed audio
has the same effect. Starting with high quality sound will
ensure the file version sounds as good as possible.</p>

<h2>Audio Compression</h2>

<p>Audio compression can also have a dramatic effect on the
quality of audio, but in a very different way.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.signalleaf.com/images/blog_posts/garage-band-compression-settings.png"></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever heard a song or a podcast or a radio station
where literally everything came out at exactly the same
volume level &ndash; not matter whether the person was wispering,
or the music was supposed to be subdued and quiet &ndash; you&rsquo;ve
heard the ill-effects of over-compressing audio.</p>

<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, is classical music. If
you&rsquo;ve ever tried to listen to classical music in a car or
on public transport systems, you&rsquo;ve probably been frustrated
by the near impossible to hear quiet moments followed by
ear-splitting loud moments. This is the effect of no audio
compression at all.</p>

<h4>Controlling Signal Levels (Volume)</h4>

<p>Audio compression is a means of flattening the signal level
for the audio track(s) being compressed. It makes the quiet
parts louder so you can still hear them, and makes the loud
parts quieter so they don&rsquo;t blow your ear drums out.</p>

<p>Too much compression makes everything sound flat. It removes
all of the dynamics of the audio, preventing the natural
ebs and flows of volume differences. It tends to make things
sound over-produced. Radio stations tends to use a ton of
audio compression to compensate for road noise and other
ambient noises in the typical radio lisening environment:
transportation. Classical music, on the other hand, tends
to opt for purity and intent of the conductor and
orechestra, leaving off any audio compression of any kind.
Because of this, classical music is usally best experienced
in quiet places.</p>

<h4>Audio Compression And Podcasts</h4>

<p>You need a minimum amount of audio compression in your
podcasts &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s a music podcast or a spoken / voice
podcast. Without it, your podcast will simply come out too
quiet most of the time, with sudden and bothersome loud
moments. But at the same time, you don&rsquo;t want to over-compress
your audio. This tends to create the appearance of yelling
all the time, because there are no dyanmics or variance in
your volume levels.</p>

<h4>Learning Through Practice</h4>

<p>There are no right and wrong settings for everyone, when
it comes to audio compression, though. Each persons voice
and speech patterns are unique, creating a need for variance
in how much compression is used. You&rsquo;ll want to practice some
with different levels of compression to find out what
works best for you.</p>

<h2>Where Do I Go From Here?</h2>

<p>The topics of what settings to change for what purpose in
both audio compression and file compression are worthy of
their own blog posts. Getting the high level idea of what
these things are and how the affect your podcast is an
important step in the right direction, though. Without this
basic understanding, having all the knowledge of what settings
to change won&rsquo;t mean much.</p>

<p>For tips and advice on audio compression settings,
check out <a href="https://gist.github.com/scottburton11/3222152">Scott Burton&rsquo;s post on audio compression</a>.
This is a great starting point with advice on what the different
settings for audio compression will do. This is a post that
deserves your attention &ndash; one that I wanted to write, but
would rather share Scott&rsquo;s quality work.</p>

<p>For info on file compression, bit rates and the effects that
they have on your .mp3 file exports, check out
<a href="http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/12/18/mp3-bit-rates/">the post on MP3 bit rates, file size, and audio quality</a>.
In this post, I export the same podcast episode using 10
different bit rates (5 constant, and 5 variable) and look
at the results.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I have the pleasure of interview my friend
and fellow podcaster, John Sonmez from <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com">SimpleProgrammer.com</a>.
We talk about his podcast at <a href="http://getupandcode.com">GetupAndCode.com</a>
&ndash; a podcast that combines fitness and programming &ndash; and dig in
to his lessons learned, success and failures in podcasting. It&rsquo;s
a great episode full of useful tips for those that are just
starting as well as those that have already started to get on
a roll with a podcast.</p>

<h2>Podcast Pro-Tip</h2>

<p>Use the &ldquo;clap trick&rdquo; to sync separate tracks recorded from
different computers. One person counts to 3, and on 3, everyone
in the podcast claps. Then you can sync the separate audio
tracks to the clap at the beginning.</p>

<p><strong>Listen to the first minute of the episode for a demonstration
of this technique!</strong></p>

<h2>Show Notes</h2>

<p>Niche-down to find your target audience &ndash; don&rsquo;t try to be
everything to everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Coordination with cohost requires planning and commitment</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>have a backup episode in case you can&rsquo;t make it for some reason</li>
<li>decide on a release cadence that you can handle, and stick with it no matter what</li>
</ul>


<p>Don&rsquo;t wait for perfect. Get something done and released</p>

<p><strong>Nerves are expected when you start</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s new</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s different</li>
<li>that&rsquo;s ok</li>
<li>you will improve over time</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Mistakes happen &ndash; move on</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s a conversation between you and the host / guest</li>
<li>keep the content focused and relevant</li>
<li>just relax and have fun</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>You know something others don&rsquo;t</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if it&rsquo;s just your experience and perspective</li>
<li>your perspective is valuable</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Being new gives you a very valuable perspective</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>share your fears and mistakes with others</li>
<li>build the audience of people that are also new</li>
<li>help others learn with you</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>John&rsquo;s 3 lessons for someone just starting:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Streamlining: get all the infrastructure prep work (logo, domain name, blog, etc) done before you start recording. Start out professionally, with intro music, logo, etc (checkout fiverr.com for stuff like this)</li>
<li>Understand the process before you start. Practice by recording yourself and working through the process before you produce a real podcast. iTunes will not host your episodes (see blog.signalleaf.com for info on this)</li>
<li>Set up process, with consistency, ahead of time. Don&rsquo;t be left hanging after you record your first episode. You need to be consistent in order to grow a returning audience.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Have Your Own Tips To Share?</h2>

<p>If you have a podcast, then yes, you have lessons learned and info to
share with a growing audience. I want to interview you on

    <link href="http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/12/04/why-free-hosting-isnt-always-free/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-04T21:31:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/12/04/why-free-hosting-isnt-always-free</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I found <a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/52046/podcast-site-serve-audio-files-with-cdn/55791">a question on the StackExchange network</a>
regarding podcast hosting and the use of a CDN, with one answer
suggesting the use of SoundCloud for hosting.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am managing a small podcast website hosted on a shared server. Currently there are only eight or nine episodes, each of which are about 50 MB, so bandwidth is not really an issue at the moment.</p>

<p>However, looking forward, would it be feasible to use a &ldquo;free&rdquo; CDN like Cloudflare to serve the audio files? If so, how would I set this up?</p>

<p>I took a quick look at it before, and it seems you have to have your whole site routed (is that the right term?) through the CDN rather than just specific files or filetypes. I&rsquo;d like some clarification on this.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question and idea, but one that
comes with a lot of potential problems.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the idea behind a CDN, don&rsquo;t
worry about that. It&rsquo;s not something that most people need to
know about. If you&rsquo;re interested, though, check out
<a href="http://www.kendoui.com/blogs/teamblog/posts/13-11-07/know-when-to-cdn.aspx">my article on using CDNs in web development</a> (external link).</p>

<h2>Reduce Your File Size</h2>

<p>Before I address the hosting concerns, you should really try
to reduce your file size for the podcasts. Unless your podcast
episodes are 2 to 4 hours long, each, you shouldn&rsquo;t be
reaching 50 megs per file. Try reducing the audio quality in
your mp3 files (and use .mp3 file compression if you&rsquo;re not
already &ndash; it&rsquo;s the podcast industry standard). If you have a
45 minute podcast, you should be able to get your .mp3 file
down to around 15 to 20 megs, tops, without any significant
reduction in sound quality for spoken voice podcasts. Music
podcasts may be different, and you probably want higher
quality, but those are the exception where voice based
podcasts tend to be the rule.</p>

<h2>Free Hosting Is Almost Never &ldquo;Free&rdquo;</h2>

<p>When it comes to bandwidth and hosting, you really want to
avoid free if possible.</p>

<p>On the bandwidth side, free tends to be awful. CDNs are not
meant to be used for very large files that are downloaded
frequently, like podcast files. CDNs are typically meant for
smaller files, like static HTML, JavaScript, CSS and images.
You&rsquo;ll quickly realize just how &ldquo;free&rdquo; a free CDN is when
your downloads get throttled down to slow speeds or your
account gets shut off because you&rsquo;re using too much bandwidth.</p>

<p>In addition to bandwidth and even file size limitations on
free accounts, you will likely end up with ads placed on your
content, when using free hosting services for things like
podcasts. Maybe you don&rsquo;t mind ads being placed on your
podcast, to get free hosting. But there are some real dangers
in this <a href="http://schoolofpodcasting.com/how-to-avoid-vibrator-commercials-on-your-podcast-say-no-to-free-media-hosting/">when your podcasts suddenly have ads for sex toys in them</a>!</p>

<p>(Note: that link is mostly safe for work. It&rsquo;s an article
about the dangers of free hosting, including a story that
is rather shocking, but has no unsafe images in it).</p>

<p>Finally, there is always a risk that your free account will
be taken out from under you, for no reason. Service providers
are not obligated to continue providing free service to
anyone, in the vast majority of cases. They may decide that
they can no longer afford it, and yank the rug out from
everyone that is hosted for free, or simply close up shop and
disappear. It happens more than people want to admit.</p>

<h2>SoundCloud Has Limits On Free</h2>

<p>One of the comments on the question suggested using SoundCloud
as a podcast host. This is a common thing to do, actually.
SoundCloud offers a unique spin on hosting audio and even
provides RSS and stats for podcasts. The reponder even note
that StackExchanged used SoundCloud (which may or may not
be accurate anymore&hellip; that should be verified).</p>

<p>StackExchange may use SoundCloud for it&rsquo;s podcast hosting,
but I guarantee they don&rsquo;t use a free account. Perhaps they
have some deal with SoundCloud where they don&rsquo;t get charged
anything, but this type of discount arrangement is very
different than the free account that SoundClod offers.</p>

<p><a href="http://help.soundcloud.com/customer/portal/articles/247820-what-s-the-difference-between-each-subscription-level-">From SoundCloud&rsquo;s website</a>,
you can see exactly what limitations you will run in to with
the free account:</p>

<blockquote><p>Free</p>

<ul>
<li><p>2 total upload hours</p></li>
<li><p>100 downloads/sound</p></li>
<li><p>Unlimited playlist creation</p></li>
<li><p>Some stats (see the amount of plays, downloads, comments and favorites of your tracks)</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Free Trial and &ldquo;Freemium&rdquo; Are Legit</h2>

<p>There are other types of &ldquo;Free&rdquo; accounts than &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you
something for nothing&rdquo;, though.</p>

<p>Many services offer free trials
that give you a set time limit for using the service. This
type of &ldquo;free&rdquo; is usually legit. It gives you a way to try
out a service without having to pay anything, knowing that
if you like the service you&rsquo;ll have to pay to continue with
it. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with free trials, and I actually
encourage people to try as many free trials as they need to,
to figure out what service fits their needs the best.</p>

<p>Other services, like SoundCloud, offer a &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; service
type. This is a service that gives you free service, typically
supported by ads or other monetiziation means. The free
service will have strict limitations on what you can and
cannot do, but won&rsquo;t stop your service after a certain period
of time. The idea is that after you get in to the service,
you&rsquo;ll be hooked and you&rsquo;ll want to pay for the services to
get the better features.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s some debate about &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; services these days, with
a lot of companies saying it&rsquo;s not viable, and even some
companies going out of business because of it. Now imaging
how bad that would be if you were a paying customer of a
service and all the free accounts caused the service to go
out of business! I&rsquo;d be pretty upset about that.</p>

<h2>Your Best Option: Paid Podcast Hosting Service</h2>

<p>In the end, your best option is to pay for podcast hosting
services. There are a lot of great services available,
<strong>including my own at <a href="http://signalleaf.com">SignalLeaf.com</a></strong>,
LibSyn, Blubrry, and many more. These services start cheap &ndash;
very cheap &ndash; usually with a free trial before you actually
have to pay for anything. My <strong>SignalLeaf</strong> service has a
rather lengthy trial period compared to most. This gives you
plenty of time to figure out if you want to continue with the
service or not.</p>

<p>At only a few $ a month, paid podcast hosting services are
going to give you all the space you need for file storage and
bandwidth, provide an iTunes and other podcast app compatible
RSS feed, and give you all the stats and feedback that you
need for your podcast.</p>

<p>All of these paid services host their files on servers that
are going to stream your audio more reliably than any free
service you would find. By paying a company to host your
files, you are giving them incentive to make sure they are
keeping you happy and doing the best job possible to keep
your podcast rolling smoothly. SignalLeaf, for example,
uses Amazon S3 storage and streaming of all podcast files.
There&rsquo;s no way your listeners are going to use up the
bandwidth of S3. You&rsquo;ll never see a slow-down in delivery,
or have problems with file storage reliability.</p>

<p>Stats are also important if you&rsquo;re looking for motivation
to continue podcasting, or want sponsors. You&rsquo;re not going
to get the stats you need without paying for service, either.
Generating stats is not as simple as most people thing, which
is why it always takes a more expensive paid account to get
great stats.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Start Your Free Trial, Now!</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about your podcasts, do yourself a favor
and get <a href="http://signalleaf.com">a podcast hosting service</a> to
handle the heavy lifting and distribution of your content.
You&rsquo;ll never be happier than if reduce your own burden so
that you can focus on the content, not the content delivery.</p>

    <id>http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/11/20/episode-2-the-mic-positioning-and-room-is-more-important</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you think the quality of the microphone is going to make
or break your podcast? If you do, I&rsquo;d like to show you that
it won&rsquo;t. And if you already don&rsquo;t, then why are you still
obsessed with getting &ldquo;the right mic&rdquo;? Is it just another
excuse to not start that podcast?</p>

<p>In Episode 2 of the Signals And Leaves podcast, I&rsquo;ll show you
how the room your in, and the positioning of the mic, will
have far more impact on the quality of the recording that
you are getting.</p>

<h2>Show Notes</h2>

<p>As you can hear in this episode, having a quality mic does
make a difference in the audio recording. But that is not
the most important thing when you&rsquo;re starting your podcast. You
would be better served to find the right room in which to
record, than to go out and spend money on a top quality mic.</p>

<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean a quality mic doesn&rsquo;t make a difference.
You will hear the difference in this episode. But you&rsquo;ll also
hear the difference between an office, an ultra-echoy bathroom,
and a closet with near-perfect sound.</p>

<p>Having a good position for your microphone is also of importance,
and can make a huge difference even if you have a quality
mic to start with. At the end of the episode, I&rsquo;ll give you
several examples of good and bad mic positioning.</p>

<h4>Show Highlights</h4>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about the quality of mic</li>
<li>Worry about the room you&rsquo;re recording in</li>
<li>Worry about the microphone positioning</li>
<li>Wait until you have a few episodes under your belt before buying a quality mic</li>
</ul>


<p>When you are ready to buy, I highly recommend

This is the mic I use, and I love it. This is the industry
standard for podcasting and screencasting. You can&rsquo;t go wrong
with the Rode Podcaster.</p>

<iframe src="http://rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=signalleaf-20&o=1&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=ss_til&asins=B000JM46FY" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>If you need high quality for a little less money, though,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VA464S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VA464S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=signalleaf-20">the Blue Yeti</a>
is also a great podcast microphone. I know a lot of people that
use this one, and it&rsquo;s a great mic.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was talking with someone about a podcast
they are starting, recently, and I asked if they already had a
plan for hosting it. The response I got was surpising:</p>

<blockquote><p>we have not yet gotten to the question of hosting the podcast yet.
i was assuming we would do it though iTunes, but i haven&rsquo;t thought farther than that.</p></blockquote>

<p>This seems to be an common misunderstanding about iTunes,
unfortunately. Your subscribers find you through iTunes, right?
So, isn&rsquo;t that where you host your podcast?</p>

<p>Sorry, but no &ndash; podcasts distribution doesn&rsquo;t work like that.
Instead of uploading podcast episodes directly to iTunes, it&rsquo;s
only a network for finding and subscribing to podcast RSS feeds.
You still need your own host, bandwidth for streaming and RSS
for your podcast.</p>

<h2>iTunes And Google Maps</h2>

<p>Think of iTunes like Google Maps for podcasts. With Google
Maps, you can quickly and easily find
an address and a business, but Google Maps won&rsquo;t actually
take you there. You have to walk, drive, fly, or otherwise get
yourself to the real location that the map shows you.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.signalleaf.com/images/blog_posts/google-maps.png" width="400"></p>

<p>Podcasts in iTunes work the same way. iTunes will list your podcast
like Google Maps lists a business with an address and phone
number. You can quickly and easily find a podcast that iTunes
has listed, but your computer is only finding the address and
description of the podcast. The computer then has to travel to
the actual podcast location &ndash;  where the RSS feed is hosted.</p>

<p>When you subscribe to a podcast through iTunes, the podcast
listing that you found in iTunes was only the map for your
computer to find the actual podcast and subscribe to it.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.signalleaf.com/images/blog_posts/getupandcode.png" width="400"></p>

<p>In the case of <a href="http://getupandcode.com">Get Up And Code</a>, as
shown in the above screenshot, your computer will be redirected
to the RSS feed hosted at <a href="http://GetUpAndCode.com">http://GetUpAndCode.com</a> to create the
subscription and to get updates from their RSS feed.</p>

<h2>So, How <em>Do</em> I Host My Podcast?</h2>

<p>You can&rsquo;t host your podcast directly in iTunes, but there are
plenty of services and other options for hosting. The choices
come down to a few basic things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do it all yourself</li>
<li>Get a podcasting plugin for a blogging platform</li>
<li>Pay for a podcast hosting service</li>
</ul>


<h4>DIY</h4>

<p>The &ldquo;do-it-yourself&rdquo; crowd tends to be the software developer and
techie person that can build the software and services needed
for hosting. If you&rsquo;re not a software developer, I don&rsquo;t recommend
this path. If you <em>are</em> a software developer, I still don&rsquo;t
recommend this path. It&rsquo;s tedious and painful, and fraught with
problems.</p>

<h4>Blogging Plugins</h4>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an avid blogger and you&rsquo;re already deeply entrenched
in to WordPress or any of the other major blogging platforms, you
can find plugins to make podcast hosting easy. You can upload a
file, use the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag in your post and be done with it. But
unless you&rsquo;re hosting your own servers and/or uploading your
episodes to another service, you&rsquo;re probably going to run in to
bandwidth and other limitations.</p>

<p>Everyone that I have spoken to,
that says they are hosting a podcast on WordPress, says they
eventually ran in to problems. It can be done for small podcasts,
and it can be cheap and easy. But with substantial growth in the
populartiy of the podcast comes potential for substantial cost
and problems.</p>

<h4>Podcast Hosting Services</h4>

<p>The last option listed, paying for a podcast host, is going to
be the best option for any serious podcast. You don&rsquo;t want to
manage file security. You don&rsquo;t want to deal with server
configuration. You don&rsquo;t want to build traffic reports, manually.
You just want to podcast.</p>

<p>There are a lot of options for hosting your podcast episodes,
including SignalLeaf. I don&rsquo;t claim
to be the one-and-only solution, or the one that fits everyone&rsquo;s
needs. I do have a very simple, very flexible solution, though.

providing storage, bandwidth, RSS feed generation and traffic
analysis, then <strong>SignalLeaf is a great choice for you</strong>.</p>
