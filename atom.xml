    <updated>2013-12-04T21:31:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/12/04/why-free-hosting-isnt-always-free</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I found <a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/52046/podcast-site-serve-audio-files-with-cdn/55791">a question on the StackExchange network</a>
regarding podcast hosting and the use of a CDN, with one answer
suggesting the use of SoundCloud for hosting.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am managing a small podcast website hosted on a shared server. Currently there are only eight or nine episodes, each of which are about 50 MB, so bandwidth is not really an issue at the moment.</p>

<p>However, looking forward, would it be feasible to use a &ldquo;free&rdquo; CDN like Cloudflare to serve the audio files? If so, how would I set this up?</p>

<p>I took a quick look at it before, and it seems you have to have your whole site routed (is that the right term?) through the CDN rather than just specific files or filetypes. I&rsquo;d like some clarification on this.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question and idea, but one that
comes with a lot of potential problems.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the idea behind a CDN, don&rsquo;t
worry about that. It&rsquo;s not something that most people need to
know about. If you&rsquo;re interested, though, check out
<a href="http://www.kendoui.com/blogs/teamblog/posts/13-11-07/know-when-to-cdn.aspx">my article on using CDNs in web development</a> (external link).</p>

<h2>Reduce Your File Size</h2>

<p>Before I address the hosting concerns, you should really try
to reduce your file size for the podcasts. Unless your podcast
episodes are 2 to 4 hours long, each, you shouldn&rsquo;t be
reaching 50 megs per file. Try reducing the audio quality in
your mp3 files (and use .mp3 file compression if you&rsquo;re not
already &ndash; it&rsquo;s the podcast industry standard). If you have a
45 minute podcast, you should be able to get your .mp3 file
down to around 15 to 20 megs, tops, without any significant
reduction in sound quality for spoken voice podcasts. Music
podcasts may be different, and you probably want higher
quality, but those are the exception where voice based
podcasts tend to be the rule.</p>

<h2>Free Hosting Is Almost Never &ldquo;Free&rdquo;</h2>

<p>When it comes to bandwidth and hosting, you really want to
avoid free if possible.</p>

<p>On the bandwidth side, free tends to be awful. CDNs are not
meant to be used for very large files that are downloaded
frequently, like podcast files. CDNs are typically meant for
smaller files, like static HTML, JavaScript, CSS and images.
You&rsquo;ll quickly realize just how &ldquo;free&rdquo; a free CDN is when
your downloads get throttled down to slow speeds or your
account gets shut off because you&rsquo;re using too much bandwidth.</p>

<p>In addition to bandwidth and even file size limitations on
free accounts, you will likely end up with ads placed on your
content, when using free hosting services for things like
podcasts. Maybe you don&rsquo;t mind ads being placed on your
podcast, to get free hosting. But there are some real dangers
in this <a href="http://schoolofpodcasting.com/how-to-avoid-vibrator-commercials-on-your-podcast-say-no-to-free-media-hosting/">when your podcasts suddenly have ads for sex toys in them</a>!</p>

<p>(Note: that link is mostly safe for work. It&rsquo;s an article
about the dangers of free hosting, including a story that
is rather shocking, but has no unsafe images in it).</p>

<p>Finally, there is always a risk that your free account will
be taken out from under you, for no reason. Service providers
are not obligated to continue providing free service to
anyone, in the vast majority of cases. They may decide that
they can no longer afford it, and yank the rug out from
everyone that is hosted for free, or simply close up shop and
disappear. It happens more than people want to admit.</p>

<h2>SoundCloud Has Limits On Free</h2>

<p>One of the comments on the question suggested using SoundCloud
as a podcast host. This is a common thing to do, actually.
SoundCloud offers a unique spin on hosting audio and even
provides RSS and stats for podcasts. The reponder even note
that StackExchanged used SoundCloud (which may or may not
be accurate anymore&hellip; that should be verified).</p>

<p>StackExchange may use SoundCloud for it&rsquo;s podcast hosting,
but I guarantee they don&rsquo;t use a free account. Perhaps they
have some deal with SoundCloud where they don&rsquo;t get charged
anything, but this type of discount arrangement is very
different than the free account that SoundClod offers.</p>

<p><a href="http://help.soundcloud.com/customer/portal/articles/247820-what-s-the-difference-between-each-subscription-level-">From SoundCloud&rsquo;s website</a>,
you can see exactly what limitations you will run in to with
the free account:</p>

<blockquote><p>Free</p>

<ul>
<li><p>2 total upload hours</p></li>
<li><p>100 downloads/sound</p></li>
<li><p>Unlimited playlist creation</p></li>
<li><p>Some stats (see the amount of plays, downloads, comments and favorites of your tracks)</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Free Trial and &ldquo;Freemium&rdquo; Are Legit</h2>

<p>There are other types of &ldquo;Free&rdquo; accounts than &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you
something for nothing&rdquo;, though.</p>

<p>Many services offer free trials
that give you a set time limit for using the service. This
type of &ldquo;free&rdquo; is usually legit. It gives you a way to try
out a service without having to pay anything, knowing that
if you like the service you&rsquo;ll have to pay to continue with
it. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with free trials, and I actually
encourage people to try as many free trials as they need to,
to figure out what service fits their needs the best.</p>

<p>Other services, like SoundCloud, offer a &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; service
type. This is a service that gives you free service, typically
supported by ads or other monetiziation means. The free
service will have strict limitations on what you can and
cannot do, but won&rsquo;t stop your service after a certain period
of time. The idea is that after you get in to the service,
you&rsquo;ll be hooked and you&rsquo;ll want to pay for the services to
get the better features.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s some debate about &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; services these days, with
a lot of companies saying it&rsquo;s not viable, and even some
companies going out of business because of it. Now imaging
how bad that would be if you were a paying customer of a
service and all the free accounts caused the service to go
out of business! I&rsquo;d be pretty upset about that.</p>

<h2>Your Best Option: Paid Podcast Hosting Service</h2>

<p>In the end, your best option is to pay for podcast hosting
services. There are a lot of great services available,
<strong>including my own at <a href="http://signalleaf.com">SignalLeaf.com</a></strong>,
LibSyn, Blubrry, and many more. These services start cheap &ndash;
very cheap &ndash; usually with a free trial before you actually
have to pay for anything. My <strong>SignalLeaf</strong> service has a
rather lengthy trial period compared to most. This gives you
plenty of time to figure out if you want to continue with the
service or not.</p>

<p>At only a few $ a month, paid podcast hosting services are
going to give you all the space you need for file storage and
bandwidth, provide an iTunes and other podcast app compatible
RSS feed, and give you all the stats and feedback that you
need for your podcast.</p>

<p>All of these paid services host their files on servers that
are going to stream your audio more reliably than any free
service you would find. By paying a company to host your
files, you are giving them incentive to make sure they are
keeping you happy and doing the best job possible to keep
your podcast rolling smoothly. SignalLeaf, for example,
uses Amazon S3 storage and streaming of all podcast files.
There&rsquo;s no way your listeners are going to use up the
bandwidth of S3. You&rsquo;ll never see a slow-down in delivery,
or have problems with file storage reliability.</p>

<p>Stats are also important if you&rsquo;re looking for motivation
to continue podcasting, or want sponsors. You&rsquo;re not going
to get the stats you need without paying for service, either.
Generating stats is not as simple as most people thing, which
is why it always takes a more expensive paid account to get
great stats.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Start Your Free Trial, Now!</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about your podcasts, do yourself a favor
and get <a href="http://signalleaf.com">a podcast hosting service</a> to
handle the heavy lifting and distribution of your content.
You&rsquo;ll never be happier than if reduce your own burden so
that you can focus on the content, not the content delivery.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/11/20/episode-2-the-mic-positioning-and-room-is-more-important/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-20T08:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/11/20/episode-2-the-mic-positioning-and-room-is-more-important</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you think the quality of the microphone is going to make
or break your podcast? If you do, I&rsquo;d like to show you that
it won&rsquo;t. And if you already don&rsquo;t, then why are you still
obsessed with getting &ldquo;the right mic&rdquo;? Is it just another
excuse to not start that podcast?</p>

<p>In Episode 2 of the Signals And Leaves podcast, I&rsquo;ll show you
how the room your in, and the positioning of the mic, will
have far more impact on the quality of the recording that
you are getting.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2>Show Notes</h2>

<p>As you can hear in this episode, having a quality mic does
make a difference in the audio recording. But that is not
the most important thing when you&rsquo;re starting your podcast. You
would be better served to find the right room in which to
record, than to go out and spend money on a top quality mic.</p>

<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean a quality mic doesn&rsquo;t make a difference.
You will hear the difference in this episode. But you&rsquo;ll also
hear the difference between an office, an ultra-echoy bathroom,
and a closet with near-perfect sound.</p>

<p>Having a good position for your microphone is also of importance,
and can make a huge difference even if you have a quality
mic to start with. At the end of the episode, I&rsquo;ll give you
several examples of good and bad mic positioning.</p>

<h4>Show Highlights</h4>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about the quality of mic</li>
<li>Worry about the room you&rsquo;re recording in</li>
<li>Worry about the microphone positioning</li>
<li>Wait until you have a few episodes under your belt before buying a quality mic</li>
</ul>


<p>When you are ready to buy, I highly recommend
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JM46FY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000JM46FY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=signalleaf-20">the Rode Podcaster</a>.
This is the mic I use, and I love it. This is the industry
standard for podcasting and screencasting. You can&rsquo;t go wrong
with the Rode Podcaster.</p>

<iframe src="http://rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=signalleaf-20&o=1&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=ss_til&asins=B000JM46FY" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>If you need high quality for a little less money, though,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VA464S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VA464S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=signalleaf-20">the Blue Yeti</a>
is also a great podcast microphone. I know a lot of people that
use this one, and it&rsquo;s a great mic.</p>

<iframe src="http://rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=signalleaf-20&o=1&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=ss_til&asins=B002VA464S" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <link href="http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/11/18/cant-i-just-host-my-podcast-on-itunes/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-18T08:20:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.signalleaf.com/blog/2013/11/18/cant-i-just-host-my-podcast-on-itunes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was talking with someone about a podcast
they are starting, recently, and I asked if they already had a
plan for hosting it. The response I got was surpising:</p>

<blockquote><p>we have not yet gotten to the question of hosting the podcast yet.
i was assuming we would do it though iTunes, but i haven&rsquo;t thought farther than that.</p></blockquote>

<p>This seems to be an common misunderstanding about iTunes,
unfortunately. Your subscribers find you through iTunes, right?
So, isn&rsquo;t that where you host your podcast?</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Sorry, but no &ndash; podcasts distribution doesn&rsquo;t work like that.
Instead of uploading podcast episodes directly to iTunes, it&rsquo;s
only a network for finding and subscribing to podcast RSS feeds.
You still need your own host, bandwidth for streaming and RSS
for your podcast.</p>

<h2>iTunes And Google Maps</h2>

<p>Think of iTunes like Google Maps for podcasts. With Google
Maps, you can quickly and easily find
an address and a business, but Google Maps won&rsquo;t actually
take you there. You have to walk, drive, fly, or otherwise get
yourself to the real location that the map shows you.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.signalleaf.com/images/blog_posts/google-maps.png" width="400"></p>

<p>Podcasts in iTunes work the same way. iTunes will list your podcast
like Google Maps lists a business with an address and phone
number. You can quickly and easily find a podcast that iTunes
has listed, but your computer is only finding the address and
description of the podcast. The computer then has to travel to
the actual podcast location &ndash;  where the RSS feed is hosted.</p>

<p>When you subscribe to a podcast through iTunes, the podcast
listing that you found in iTunes was only the map for your
computer to find the actual podcast and subscribe to it.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.signalleaf.com/images/blog_posts/getupandcode.png" width="400"></p>

<p>In the case of <a href="http://getupandcode.com">Get Up And Code</a>, as
shown in the above screenshot, your computer will be redirected
to the RSS feed hosted at <a href="http://GetUpAndCode.com">http://GetUpAndCode.com</a> to create the
subscription and to get updates from their RSS feed.</p>

<h2>So, How <em>Do</em> I Host My Podcast?</h2>

<p>You can&rsquo;t host your podcast directly in iTunes, but there are
plenty of services and other options for hosting. The choices
come down to a few basic things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do it all yourself</li>
<li>Get a podcasting plugin for a blogging platform</li>
<li>Pay for a podcast hosting service</li>
</ul>


<h4>DIY</h4>

<p>The &ldquo;do-it-yourself&rdquo; crowd tends to be the software developer and
techie person that can build the software and services needed
for hosting. If you&rsquo;re not a software developer, I don&rsquo;t recommend
this path. If you <em>are</em> a software developer, I still don&rsquo;t
recommend this path. It&rsquo;s tedious and painful, and frought with
problems.</p>

<h4>Blogging Plugins</h4>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an avid blogger and you&rsquo;re already deeply entrenched
in to WordPress or any of the other major blogging platforms, you
can find plugins to make podcast hosting easy. You can upload a
file, use the <code>[audio]</code> tag in your post and be done with it. But
unless you&rsquo;re hosting your own servers and/or uploading your
episodes to another service, you&rsquo;re probably going to run in to
bandwidth and other limitations.</p>

<p>Everyone that I have spoken to,
that says they are hosting a podcast on WordPress, says they
eventually ran in to problems. It can be done for small podcasts,
and it can be cheap and easy. But with substantial growth in the
populartiy of the podcast comes potential for substantial cost
and problems.</p>

<h4>Podcast Hosting Services</h4>

<p>The last option listed, paying for a podcast host, is going to
be the best option for any serious podcast. You don&rsquo;t want to
manage file security. You don&rsquo;t want to deal with server
configuration. You don&rsquo;t want to build traffic reports, manually.
You just want to podcast.</p>

<p>There are a lot of options for hosting your podcast episodes,
including SignalLeaf. I don&rsquo;t claim
to be the one-and-only solution, or the one that fits everyone&rsquo;s
needs. I do have a very simple, very flexible solution, though.
If you&rsquo;re looking for a podcast host that focuses solely on
providing storage, bandwidth, RSS feed generation and traffic
analysis, then <strong>SignalLeaf is a great choice for you</strong>.</p>
