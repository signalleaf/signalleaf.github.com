**Episode 4 of the Signals & Leaves, with [Craig McKeachie](http://www.funnyant.com/).**

Craig is starting up a new podcast on front-end web development
and is going through all the usual steps of getting started,
getting episodes recorded and getting them published.

This episode was recorded live at [CodeMash 2014](http://codemash.org)
in a room that was full of noise from ventilation and other
environmental things. I used [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/)
to clean up the noise, which worked surprisingly well. There is
some noise leftover during louder portions of the audio, though.

### Podcast Pro-tip

**Don't forget your guests' name or credentials.** 

This one is rather embarassing, I must say. Right as I was
starting the episode with Craig, I forgot his name. My brain
went completely blank. We laught it off at the beginning of
the episode, but it makes for a bad start to the episode.

### Equipment

This episode was recorded entirely with a [Roland R05](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IJ3WIW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003IJ3WIW&linkCode=as2&tag=signalleaf-20).

### Notes

Podcasting is a great way to build an audience. It creates a
more intimate connection with listeners, vs written words.

Having multiple forms of media, such as book, blog, podcast,
etc, helps you build authority.

Podcasts introduce conversation instead of monologue. It's
easier to generate ideas, create something more valuable and
get more out of a conversation than a monologue, at times.

Choosing a name is hard - don't want to be too narrow, but
also want to identify and serve your audience, and deliver 
value.

Getting feedback from trusted resources can give you confidence.
Even if you figure things out, find resources that teach you
and verify what you've learned.

Podcast hosting eats up a lot of bandwidth. Be sure you have
a host that can handle the bandwidth. Find [a podcast host](http://signalleaf.com)
when possible.

Average life of a podcast episode is 6 weeks. Bandwidth is
typically measured per month, but bandwidth for an episode can
be estimated from the 6 week download trend for past episodes.

Be careful of Feedburner and other free services. Feedburner
limits you to 512K feed size, and will drop episodes to keep
it small. FeedBlitz and other paid services won't introduce
this type of limit.

Your podcast needs RSS that is compatible with as many devices
and directories as possible. If your podcast hosting doesn't
ensure this, you will want to use a third party feed distribution
system like FeedBlitz.

Find a podcast / RSS host that provides the analytics you
need. [SignalLeaf](http://signalleaf.com) gives you a breakdown of
RSS vs embeded player vs downloads, for traffic reports.

Trade iTunes directory reviews with other podcasters. Find podcasts
that you're interested in. Listen to a few episodes, then contact
the author and ask them to review your podcast in exchange for
you reviewing them.

You need a blog for your podcast, whether it's part of your
primary website or a separate blog. Write a post for each
episode with a short list of notes from the episode, at least.
