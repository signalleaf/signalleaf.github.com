I have [my own equipment list](/equipment), my [how to get started](/how-to-podcast)
and more info on this blog. It's the place where I'm putting toghether info
from my experiences and experiments, to try and help people that are new
to podcasting get up and running quickly. But there's also a ton of other
resources out there, from other podcasters. I've oftend looked at these
blog posts and page for equipment ideas, how-to info, and more. And I wanted
to share some of these so that you could also benefit from the knowledge
and experience that I've been able to benefit from.

## Scott Hanselman

He also has a great blog posts about the equipment, software, process and
services that he uses for his podcats, titled:

## Pat Flynn

Pat Flynn's [Smart Passive Income](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/) podcast,
blog and other resources are a place that I like to go when I'm looking for
information on running and growing a small business. His podcast episodes and
blog posts have provided a lot of inspriation for me and ideas for figuring out
what I'm doing with SignalLeaf, and more. 

In addition to his podcast on small business, Pat has a great [resources](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/resources/)

services that he uses and recommends for online business and blogging.

Ray is producing. 

Ray's Podcasters' Roundtable is a great format where he gets multiple podcasters
together on Google+ to discuss thoughts on specific podcasting topics, often
