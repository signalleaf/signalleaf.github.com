There's not shortage of people and websites claiming that they
have "the right equipment" for you to get started with your
podcast. Even [this blog](/equipment)
has an equipment list. And there seems to be a constant clammor
for more, all around the internet. I'll make it simple 
for you, though: **start with what you have, or pick something 
quickly and move on**. 

Choosing the right
equipment or the right software is a waste of time right now. 
You need to be more concerned with preparing and producing the 
content of your podcast at this point.

## The "Right Equipment" Is The Wrong Idea

When you were learning to ride a bicycle, did your parents buy
you a $10,000 racing bike and enter you in the Tour de France?
When you were teaching your child to walk, did you buy them a
$300 pair of running shoes and ask them to run the Boston
Marathon? Of course not! The idea of that is ridiculous! Why,
then, do we expect people to buy new equipment and "do it
right" when they are starting out with podcasting?

Wait... you don't believe that this is happening? A casual search 
on twitter reveals a number of people frustrated or waiting
because they don't have the right equipment, or asking about what 
equipment they should get before they start.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/SignalLeaf">@SignalLeaf</a> I have been researching this for weeks now and everything I have read has said the complete opposite to not start cheap. Lol</p>&mdash; Michael Wright (@MrWrightNow78) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrWrightNow78/statuses/417126714884780032">December 29, 2013</a></blockquote>

These tweets often look like this:

> I want to start a podcast, but I don't have the right equipment

Or

> What equipment do I need to start a podcast?

These are questions on which people often get stuck. They assume
that you need a setup that looks like this:

But I'm going to let you in on a little secret... **your podcast
"studio" is going to look more like this, when you start**:

![](/images/blog_posts/laptop.jpg)

Let me make this very clear: **if you have a computer with a mic and an internet connection, you
already have the right equipment.**

## No More Excuses

The truth is, **a lot of people use the idea of not having "the
right equipment" as an excuse** - even if they don't realize it. 
It's easy to hide behind the
idea that you need to spend a lot of money on equipment. It's
easy to say that you'll get started once you save up enough to
get the right microphone. It's easy to put this off, because
it takes no effort. It takes no work. There is no committment
involved in not doing anything. Talk is cheap, and talking
about how you want to do this, but can't because you don't
the right equipment, is the cheapest of the cheap.

**The first podcast experience that you have is more about you
than anything else**. It's about you getting comforable with the
idea of recording, of producing something, and putting your
thoughts out there for the world to hear. It's not about the
equipment that you do or don't have. 

It's like [Jenny Brewster](http://jennybrewster.com/podcasting-equipment/)
said: 

> Record in the Cupboard if that’s where you’re happy

Sure, if you happen to have
some equipment already, it might make your first episode sound
better. But it's not about the quality, when you're starting
out. **Starting is all about getting up and running quickly.**

Yes, there is at a bare minimum amount of
equipment that you do need. The good news is that you 
have everything you need, already.

## A Computer, A Mic, And Internet Connection

If you're reading this, you're using a computer.
Your computer may be called an iPhone or an iPad, it may be
an Android or a laptop of some sort. There are a lot of different
computers with a lot of different names. But they are all
computers and most of them can be used for recording your
podcast. **The easiest computer to use for your first episode
is going to be a laptop, but nearly any computer and microphone 
will work**.

Speaking of microphones, that is something you need to
have in order to record your podcast. But,
nearly every computer comes with some sort of microphone built 
in to it these days. If you have a headset with a mic, for gaming
or to use for Skyp and other chat services, that's even
better! You'll get better sound out of a headset than you will
out of a laptop mic. But **I wouldn't let a laptop mic stop you
from starting your podcast**. If it can record your voice, it can
be used to produce your podcast.

Lastly, **you'll need access to the internet with a
fair upload speed**. Smart phones, tablets, laptops and PCs of all sorts
have built-in internet connections that let us get online and
find everything we never wanted to know, and more! This same
internet connection is needed for uploading your podcast
episode to your podcast hosting service. But don't worry too
much about this. **The connection is only really needed when you
are uploading your episode**. You won't need a connection to
record a podcast, if you are only recording yourself or if
you have all of your guests in the same room as you.

## Published And Flawed Is Better Than Not Published

This really is the point of what I'm trying to say: it's far
better to have published a flawed podcast with less than perfect 
audio quality, than to wait for the right equipment. 

**Podcasting is like any other skill - it takes practices, not
money, to get good at it**. Producing your first podcast may
feel awkward, but this is normal. Everyone goes through this
the first time they record something. But you'll find
that over time, your podcast quality will naturally improve.
You'll get better at speaking. You'll get better at positioning
the microphone. You'll be become more comfortable, and you'll
enjoy the process much more. 

*Don't wait for the right equipment. Use the equipment that you
have right now, and get started!*
