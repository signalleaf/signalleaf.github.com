## Publish Your First Podcast

Today, I'm happy to announce the availability of my e-book,
"<a href="/how-to-podcast">Prepare, Produce, Publish: Your First Podcast In 3 Easy Steps!</a>"

This book is all about getting you started in the world of
podcasting. From the equipment that you need (*and don't need!*)
to using Audacity for recording your first episode, and how
to publish your podcast through a hosting service, this book
covers it all for for the new podcaster!

## Early Bird Pricing And Updates

This ebook is currently a work in progress. That means it is 
not yet complete, but it still provides a ton of value as-is. 
That also means that **you, dear podcaster, get to purchase the 
book at a discounted price!** Better hurry, though... this 
discount won't last forever! Once I've got the book completed, 
the price will jump!

In addition to getting it cheaper, you will also get all of
the updates, free! As soon as I publish an update to the book
you will have it available in your downloads, guaranteed. That 
means you'll get all of the step by step instructions, tips 
and tricks to publish your podcast as I write them!
