Bandwidth for streaming podcasts is expensive, and using it
up with podcast audio that is too quiet, then too loud, then 
too quiet again is a giant waste of money. **Fear not!** Just 
toss in a little bit of compression and you can **save money, 
conserve bandwidth, and please the ears of your listeners** 
all at the same time.

But... audio compression, or file compression? Wait, what's
the difference? I'm already exporting to .mp3 files, and 
they're compressed, right? Yes, but that's file compression.
Audio compression is something entirely different, and is
just as important. Knowing when you have enough compression
of both kinds is also important, and knowing what they are
and how they affect your podcast is critical.

with file compression. You've seen it and its effects more
times than you can count.
