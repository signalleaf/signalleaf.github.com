Do you think the quality of the microphone is going to make
or break your podcast? If you do, I'd like to show you that
it won't. And if you already don't, then why are you still
obsessed with getting "the right mic"? Is it just another
excuse to not start that podcast? 

In Episode 2 of the Signals And Leaves podcast, I'll show you 
how the room your in, and the positioning of the mic, will 
have far more impact on the quality of the recording that 
you are getting.

## Show Notes

As you can hear in this episode, having a quality mic does
make a difference in the audio recording. But that is not
the most important thing when you're starting your podcast. You
would be better served to find the right room in which to
record, than to go out and spend money on a top quality mic.

Now that doesn't mean a quality mic doesn't make a difference.
You will hear the difference in this episode. But you'll also
hear the difference between an office, an ultra-echoy bathroom,
and a closet with near-perfect sound. 

Having a good position for your microphone is also of importance,
and can make a huge difference even if you have a quality
mic to start with. At the end of the episode, I'll give you
several examples of good and bad mic positioning.

#### Show Highlights

* Don't worry about the quality of mic
* Worry about the room you're recording in
* Worry about the microphone positioning
* Wait until you have a few episodes under your belt before buying a quality mic

When you are ready to buy, I highly recommend

This is the mic I use, and I love it. This is the industry
standard for podcasting and screencasting. You can't go wrong

If you need high quality for a little less money, though, 
[the Blue Yeti](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VA464S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002VA464S&linkCode=as2&tag=signalleaf-20)
is also a great podcast microphone. I know a lot of people that
use this one, and it's a great mic.
