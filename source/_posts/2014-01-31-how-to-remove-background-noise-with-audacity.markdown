Noise from ventilation systems, cars driving down the street, 
keeping yourself warm with a heater, or even the hum of
flourescent lighting - these are all sources of background 
noise that can make or break your audio quality. Having a
constant hum or buzz in the background can be very distracting
and cause people to turn away from your podcast. Fortunately,
the [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) audio 
editing app can help you get rid of the noise in a few... 
not quite so straight forward steps. Not to worry, though - 
while the 2 step process may be a little bit odd when you 
first see it, it is not difficult to understand or accomplish.

## The Video

I've put together a short video to demonstrate how to use
Audacity to clean up your audio. It's 7 minutes of step by
step instructions, including a demonstration of the original
audio and the cleaned up audio. Check it out on 
[my Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT-Yk9zHKf4), 
or watch it here, embedded in this blog post.

## The Audio

In addition to the video on how to use Audacity to clean up
your audio, I've also got two podcast episodes to demonstrate
the difference. 

#### The Original

In this original source file, you will hear a constant hum
in the background, from a ventilation intake right outside of
my office. You may have to turn up the volume a bit to hear
it, but it is unmistakably there.

#### The Cleaned Up

Now in this second version of the same audio file, I've used
Audacity to clean up the background noise. The effect is
dramatic - the noise is gone during the quiet periods of the
episode. But, it is not perfect. If you have high quality
headphones, you will be able to hear a little bit of 
distortion or noise in the low-end frequencies while I am
speaking. You may not hear it if your headset is not of
high enough quality, or if there is too much noise where you
are listening, but it is there.

#### Additional Cleanup?

Note that it is possible to do additional cleanup of the
remaining low frequency noise during my speaking. I left this 
as-is, though, to demonstrate some of the limitations of what 
the noise removal tool are. I may, at some other point, show 
how to do additional processing to clean this up a bit more, 
but that will be another post for another time.

## Professional Audio Cleanup

It's fairly simple to add at least a modest amount of audio
clean to your process, as you've seen here. However, there
are some limitations to what Audacity can do, and it does take
a lot of practice and experience to really get things perfect.
You may find yourself in a situation where you don't have time
to learn all the tricks, or you need some additional expertise
in cleaning up and doing post-production audio work. If that's
the case, you might want to look in to an audio production
service such as [PodcastFastTrac](http://www.podcastfasttrack.com/).
