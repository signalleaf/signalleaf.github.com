Welcome to the new [SignalLeaf](http://signalleaf.com) blog! 
Consider this the obligatory "hello world!" blog post for the
new blog: Signals And Leaves

## About SignalLeaf

[SignalLeaf](http://signalleaf.com) is a small, but growing podcast audio hosting service.
Other podcast hosts want to up-sell you on features like 
content management, advertising inserts, specialized podcasting
apps, and other bits that you won't need. SignalLeaf is different
in that I focus solely on four critical features that you need
for your podcast:

0. .mp3 file hosting
0. RSS feed generation for podcast subscribers
0. Bandwidth for streaming episodes to your listeners
0. Traffic and analysis reports

This pin-point focus on the services that SignalLeaf offers means
you are free to build a website that fits your needs, without
worrying about whether or not your podcast will fit in to it.
You can use any platform and any tools to build your site, and
embed podcast episodes from SignalLeaf, with ease!

Already have a blog or a site? Setting up a blog with 
[WordPress](http://www.signalleaf.com/help/use-with-wordpress) 
or [Tumblr](http://www.signalleaf.com/help/use-with-tumblr)? 
Building a site on your own, using the
tools and skills that you already posess will not stop you from
adding a podcast. Just grab 
[the emded code](http://www.signalleaf.com/help/use-the-signalleaf-media-player)
