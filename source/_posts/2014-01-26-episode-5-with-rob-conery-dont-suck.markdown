In this episode of the Signals & Leaves podcast, I have the
pleasure of interviewing [Rob Conery](https://twitter.com/robconery)
- a well known software developer, 
[blogger](http://wekeroad.com), 
[screencaster](http://tekpub.com) and 
[podcaster](http://thisdeveloperslife.com). 

Rob has an amazing
ability to create compelling stories out of interviews and
additional information that he gathers while researching a 
subject. He has a knack for finding what he calls "the truth"
in an interview - that deep down part of the story where
the person talking is lost in thought, expressing their 
inner-most sense of themselves in whatever they are talking
about. And I was lucky enough to get Rob to share how he
approaches story tellign in podcast, how he digs further for
the truth of the story, and how he puts it all together to
create something wonderful.

## The Interview

Along the path of this interview, Rob turns the tables on
me and shows how he approaches this by interviewing me about
this podcast. He talks about what it's like to keep digging
and to really listen for that moment when the speaker's voice
changes - the nuance that says the speaker is finally down to
the point where they are speaking from the heart of the
matter. 

There more to it the interview than just the art of story
telling, though. We cover teaching, editing, adding dramatic
pause and affecting the over-all story as well. 

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, you'll also find out 
what Rob means when he tells you, "Don't suck." Don't suck
at podcasting. Don't suck at conversations. Just don't suck.
It sounds like a rude awakening, and it may be for some. But
the point he makes is tremendously valuable.
