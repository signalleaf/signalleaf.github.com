## Join The New Media Revolution, Today!

Podcasting is one of the fastest growing media forms today, and 
for good reason. We, as humans, need to have a sense of 
belonging, a sense of being part of something larger than 
ourselves - especially in this age of technology and social 
media. More than ever, we need to be connected to the world 
around us and to those that share similar thoughts. Podcasting 
gives us the chance to connect with others like us and be part 
of something larger. And it lets us create deep and meaningful 
connections through sounds, voices, and discussions. 

## Build Deep, Meaningful Connections

From business to video games, from narrowly focused and niche 
topics to broad ranging conversations, people want to hear what 
you have to say. Don't let the fear of putting yourself out 
there stop you. Don't hide behind the notion of needing "the 
right equipment". And don't wait for someone else to come along 
and do all the work for you. Buckle down and put in the tiny 
bit of work that it takes to get your first episode published! 
Getting past that  first-episode-hurdle is a rewarding and 
fulfilling experience  and it just gets easier from there!

## Publish Your First Podcast In Record Time

Podcasting is not an insurmountable feat. That sense of dread 
when you look at the cliff in front of you comes from not 
knowing that there's a staircase right next to you. And the 
steps to get your first episode out the door are easier to 
climb than you think! Find out just how easy it is to get your 
podcast recorded, uploaded and embedded in your website and RSS 
feed, today!
