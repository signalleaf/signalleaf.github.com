  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back, one of the SignalLeaf users notified me of a
problem with their episode download stats. In a podcast that
has near 50 episodes with around 1,200 listens per episode
on average, one of the episodes spiked up to more than
22,000 listens&hellip; at least, the episode report said it did.
That didn&rsquo;t seem right to the podcaster, and certainly didn&rsquo;t
seem right to me. And it turns out it wasn&rsquo;t right&hellip; at least,
it wasn&rsquo;t the expected results even if it was technically
correct.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of debate around whether or not you should &ldquo;rent
or own&rdquo; your podcast&rsquo;s RSS feed these days. Should you be
completely responsible for it? Should you own it &ndash; host it on
your website? Or should you rent your RSS
feed&rsquo;s delivery through a 3rd party service? While the debate
rages on with good arguments on either side of the fence, there&rsquo;s
ultimately only one thing that matters &ndash; just one thing you
need to ensure, that will make or break your RSS feed and your
podcast.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Blogging is soooo last decade, right? It&rsquo;s the old, new media
revolution. Everyone built a blog and wrote about what they had
for breakfast. And didn&rsquo;t blogging get replaced by social media
sites dedicated to your favorite food pics?</p>

<p>Truth is, blogging is more important than ever. If you&rsquo;re
trying to build an audience of any kind, you need a blog. Of
course you might not want to fill your blog will your instamatic
style, vintage food photos &ndash; unless your blog is focused on
that. Your blog should be focused and reflect the content that
the audience want, wants to read. And yes, your audience of
podcast listeners also need you to have a blog.</p>

<p>If aren&rsquo;t already doing this, you need to start blogging
every episode of your podcast. And I&rsquo;ve got 50 reasons why
you need to start, today.</p>

<p>For some, podcasting is a creative outlet. It provides a way for
them to build an audience and create relationships and connections
with other like minded people. For the creative types that do
this for fun, having reports to show them how many listeners
they are getting is nice. They get to see how many people they
are potentially influencing, and it may help to drive them to
do more or do better.</p>

<p>For others, though, podcasting is more than just a hobby or an
outlet. It&rsquo;s a way of creating income, of sustaining themselves
or their family. For these podcaster, reports are critical.
They need to see how many downloads an individual episode has.
They need to see trends on what episodes are most effective.
They need to report these numbers to sponsors and potential
sponsors, so they can continue to bring in the income they
need.</p>

<p>With two very distinct audiences to serve, a report system for
a podcast can become overwhelming or underwhelming quickly. A
podcaster looking for simple reports may not care about having
everything. A podcaster that needs everything may get frustrated
at not having enough. Targeting different levels of reprots at
these two different audiences becomes important. But just having
this split doesn&rsquo;t answer the one fundamental question:</p>

<blockquote><p>What reports do you need?</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The web is full of great information on what you should be doing
when starting a podcast. There are hundreds, if not thousands,
of blog posts and web sites dedicated to helping you get up
and running &ndash; this one included. It doesn&rsquo;t take much more than
a google search or asking on twitter to find what you need to
know!</p>

<p>But this isn&rsquo;t another one of those feel-good, tell me what
I need posts. Rather, I want to mention a few of the things
that you should avoid doing when you&rsquo;re starting out. Understanding
what you should <em>not</em> do is just as important as understanding
what you <em>should</em> be doing &ndash; sometimes more important. These are
the things that will drive you to drink, if you&rsquo;re not careful.
These are the things that you should avoid doing, at all costs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Noise from ventilation systems, cars driving down the street,
keeping yourself warm with a heater or even the hum of
flourescent lighting &ndash; these are all sources of background
noise that can make or break your audio quality.</p>

<p>Having a
constant hum or buzz in the background can be very distracting
and cause people to turn away from your podcast. Fortunately,
the <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> audio
editing app can help you get rid of the noise in a few&hellip;
not quite so straight forward steps. Not to worry, though &ndash;
while the 2 step process may be a little bit odd when you
first see it, it is not difficult to understand or accomplish.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this episode of the Signals &amp; Leaves podcast, I have the
pleasure of interviewing <a href="https://twitter.com/robconery">Rob Conery</a>
&ndash; a well known software developer,
<a href="http://wekeroad.com">blogger</a>,
<a href="http://tekpub.com">screencaster</a> and
<a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com">podcaster</a>.</p>

<p>Rob has an amazing
ability to create compelling stories out of interviews and
additional information that he gathers while researching a
subject. He has a knack for finding what he calls &ldquo;the truth&rdquo;
in an interview &ndash; that deep down part of the story where
the person talking is lost in thought, expressing their
inner-most sense of themselves in whatever they are talking
about. And I was lucky enough to get Rob to share how he
approaches story tellign in podcast, how he digs further for
the truth of the story, and how he puts it all together to
create something wonderful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s good to be heard, to have your voice out there and share
your knowledge and experience with the world. Even better is
having some traffic so that you can know that you are being
heard. Sharing your favorite podcasts with your friends and
fellow bloggers and readers helps you become an authority on
the things you love, but also helps to spread the love by
giving those that deserve an audience a chance to be heard by
more people.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I&rsquo;ve got a few new podcasts that I want to
share with you today. With these, you&rsquo;ll pick up on some
pop culture references, plenty of video games, and you may even
walk away being a little more prepared for life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Signals And Leaves, Episode 4 with <a href="http://www.funnyant.com/">Craig McKeachie</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Craig is starting up a new podcast on front-end web development
and is going through all the usual steps of getting started,
getting episodes recorded and getting them published.</p>

<p>This episode was recorded live at <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash 2014</a>
in a room that was full of noise from ventilation and other
environmental things. I used <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>
to clean up the noise, which worked surprisingly well. There is
some noise leftover during louder portions of the audio, though.</p>
